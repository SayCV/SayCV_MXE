+1 Overview of `make'
+********************
+
+The `make' utility automatically determines which pieces of a large
+program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
+This manual describes GNU `make', which was implemented by Richard
+Stallman and Roland McGrath.  Development since Version 3.76 has been
+handled by Paul D. Smith.
+
+   GNU `make' conforms to section 6.2 of `IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992'
+(POSIX.2).  
+
+   Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you
+can use `make' with any programming language whose compiler can be run
+with a shell command.  Indeed, `make' is not limited to programs.  You
+can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated
+automatically from others whenever the others change.

+
+Preparing and Running Make
+==========================
+
+   To prepare to use `make', you must write a file called the
+"makefile" that describes the relationships among files in your program
+and provides commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically,
+the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn
+made by compiling source files.
+
+   Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source
+files, this simple shell command:
+
+     make
+
+suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The `make' program
+uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the
+files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of
+those files, it issues the recipes recorded in the data base.
+
+   You can provide command line arguments to `make' to control which
+files should be recompiled, or how.  *Note How to Run `make': Running.

+
+1.1 How to Read This Manual
+===========================
+
+If you are new to `make', or are looking for a general introduction,
+read the first few sections of each chapter, skipping the later
+sections.  In each chapter, the first few sections contain introductory
+or general information and the later sections contain specialized or
+technical information.  The exception is the second chapter, *note An
+Introduction to Makefiles: Introduction, all of which is introductory.
+
+   If you are familiar with other `make' programs, see *note Features
+of GNU `make': Features, which lists the enhancements GNU `make' has,
+and *note Incompatibilities and Missing Features: Missing, which
+explains the few things GNU `make' lacks that others have.

+
+1.2 Problems and Bugs
+=====================
+
+If you have problems with GNU `make' or think you've found a bug,
+please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything but
+we might well want to fix it.
+
+   Before reporting a bug, make sure you've actually found a real bug.
+Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
+what you're trying to do.  If it's not clear whether you should be able
+to do something or not, report that too; it's a bug in the
+documentation!
+
+   Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate
+it to the smallest possible makefile that reproduces the problem.  Then
+send us the makefile and the exact results `make' gave you, including
+any error or warning messages.  Please don't paraphrase these messages:
+it's best to cut and paste them into your report.  When generating this
+small makefile, be sure to not use any non-free or unusual tools in
+your recipes: you can almost always emulate what such a tool would do
+with simple shell commands.  Finally, be sure to explain what you
+expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the problem was
+really in the documentation.
+
+   Once you have a precise problem you can report it in one of two ways.
+Either send electronic mail to:
+
+         bug-make@gnu.org
+
+or use our Web-based project management tool, at:
+
+         http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/
+
+In addition to the information above, please be careful to include the
+version number of `make' you are using.  You can get this information
+with the command `make --version'.  Be sure also to include the type of
+machine and operating system you are using.  One way to obtain this
+information is by looking at the final lines of output from the command
+`make --help'.

+
+2 An Introduction to Makefiles
+******************************
+
+You need a file called a "makefile" to tell `make' what to do.  Most
+often, the makefile tells `make' how to compile and link a program.  
+
+   In this chapter, we will discuss a simple makefile that describes
+how to compile and link a text editor which consists of eight C source
+files and three header files.  The makefile can also tell `make' how to
+run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove
+certain files as a clean-up operation).  To see a more complex example
+of a makefile, see *note Complex Makefile::.
+
+   When `make' recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must
+be recompiled.  If a header file has changed, each C source file that
+includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe.  Each
+compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.
+Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files,
+whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked
+together to produce the new executable editor.

+
+2.1 What a Rule Looks Like
+==========================
+
+A simple makefile consists of "rules" with the following shape:
+
+     TARGET ... : PREREQUISITES ...
+             RECIPE
+             ...
+             ...
+
+   A "target" is usually the name of a file that is generated by a
+program; examples of targets are executable or object files.  A target
+can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as `clean' (*note
+Phony Targets::).
+
+   A "prerequisite" is a file that is used as input to create the
+target.  A target often depends on several files.
+
+   A "recipe" is an action that `make' carries out.  A recipe may have
+more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line.
+*Please note:* you need to put a tab character at the beginning of
+every recipe line!  This is an obscurity that catches the unwary.  If
+you prefer to prefix your recipes with a character other than tab, you
+can set the `.RECIPEPREFIX' variable to an alternate character (*note
+Special Variables::).
+
+   Usually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to
+create a target file if any of the prerequisites change.  However, the
+rule that specifies a recipe for the target need not have
+prerequisites.  For example, the rule containing the delete command
+associated with the target `clean' does not have prerequisites.
+
+   A "rule", then, explains how and when to remake certain files which
+are the targets of the particular rule.  `make' carries out the recipe
+on the prerequisites to create or update the target.  A rule can also
+explain how and when to carry out an action.  *Note Writing Rules:
+Rules.
+
+   A makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple
+makefile need only contain rules.  Rules may look somewhat more
+complicated than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more
+or less.
+

+
+2.2 A Simple Makefile
+=====================
+
+Here is a straightforward makefile that describes the way an executable
+file called `edit' depends on eight object files which, in turn, depend
+on eight C source and three header files.
+
+   In this example, all the C files include `defs.h', but only those
+defining editing commands include `command.h', and only low level files
+that change the editor buffer include `buffer.h'.
+
+     edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+            insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+             cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+                        insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+     main.o : main.c defs.h
+             cc -c main.c
+     kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
+             cc -c kbd.c
+     command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
+             cc -c command.c
+     display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
+             cc -c display.c
+     insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h
+             cc -c insert.c
+     search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h
+             cc -c search.c
+     files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h
+             cc -c files.c
+     utils.o : utils.c defs.h
+             cc -c utils.c
+     clean :
+             rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+                insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+We split each long line into two lines using backslash/newline; this is
+like using one long line, but is easier to read.  *Note Splitting Long
+Lines: Splitting Lines.  
+
+   To use this makefile to create the executable file called `edit',
+type:
+
+     make
+
+   To use this makefile to delete the executable file and all the object
+files from the directory, type:
+
+     make clean
+
+   In the example makefile, the targets include the executable file
+`edit', and the object files `main.o' and `kbd.o'.  The prerequisites
+are files such as `main.c' and `defs.h'.  In fact, each `.o' file is
+both a target and a prerequisite.  Recipes include `cc -c main.c' and
+`cc -c kbd.c'.
+
+   When a target is a file, it needs to be recompiled or relinked if any
+of its prerequisites change.  In addition, any prerequisites that are
+themselves automatically generated should be updated first.  In this
+example, `edit' depends on each of the eight object files; the object
+file `main.o' depends on the source file `main.c' and on the header
+file `defs.h'.
+
+   A recipe may follow each line that contains a target and
+prerequisites.  These recipes say how to update the target file.  A tab
+character (or whatever character is specified by the `.RECIPEPREFIX'
+variable; *note Special Variables::) must come at the beginning of
+every line in the recipe to distinguish recipes from other lines in the
+makefile.  (Bear in mind that `make' does not know anything about how
+the recipes work.  It is up to you to supply recipes that will update
+the target file properly.  All `make' does is execute the recipe you
+have specified when the target file needs to be updated.)  
+
+   The target `clean' is not a file, but merely the name of an action.
+Since you normally do not want to carry out the actions in this rule,
+`clean' is not a prerequisite of any other rule.  Consequently, `make'
+never does anything with it unless you tell it specifically.  Note that
+this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it also does not have any
+prerequisites, so the only purpose of the rule is to run the specified
+recipe.  Targets that do not refer to files but are just actions are
+called "phony targets".  *Note Phony Targets::, for information about
+this kind of target.  *Note Errors in Recipes: Errors, to see how to
+cause `make' to ignore errors from `rm' or any other command.  
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: How Make Works,  Next: Variables Simplify,  Prev: Simple Makefile,  Up: Introduction
+
+2.3 How `make' Processes a Makefile
+===================================
+
+By default, `make' starts with the first target (not targets whose
+names start with `.').  This is called the "default goal".  ("Goals"
+are the targets that `make' strives ultimately to update.    You can
+override this behavior using the command line (*note Arguments to
+Specify the Goals: Goals.) or with the `.DEFAULT_GOAL' special variable
+(*note Other Special Variables: Special Variables.).  
+
+   In the simple example of the previous section, the default goal is to
+update the executable program `edit'; therefore, we put that rule first.
+
+   Thus, when you give the command:
+
+     make
+
+`make' reads the makefile in the current directory and begins by
+processing the first rule.  In the example, this rule is for relinking
+`edit'; but before `make' can fully process this rule, it must process
+the rules for the files that `edit' depends on, which in this case are
+the object files.  Each of these files is processed according to its
+own rule.  These rules say to update each `.o' file by compiling its
+source file.  The recompilation must be done if the source file, or any
+of the header files named as prerequisites, is more recent than the
+object file, or if the object file does not exist.
+
+   The other rules are processed because their targets appear as
+prerequisites of the goal.  If some other rule is not depended on by the
+goal (or anything it depends on, etc.), that rule is not processed,
+unless you tell `make' to do so (with a command such as `make clean').
+
+   Before recompiling an object file, `make' considers updating its
+prerequisites, the source file and header files.  This makefile does not
+specify anything to be done for them--the `.c' and `.h' files are not
+the targets of any rules--so `make' does nothing for these files.  But
+`make' would update automatically generated C programs, such as those
+made by Bison or Yacc, by their own rules at this time.
+
+   After recompiling whichever object files need it, `make' decides
+whether to relink `edit'.  This must be done if the file `edit' does
+not exist, or if any of the object files are newer than it.  If an
+object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than `edit', so `edit'
+is relinked.  
+
+   Thus, if we change the file `insert.c' and run `make', `make' will
+compile that file to update `insert.o', and then link `edit'.  If we
+change the file `command.h' and run `make', `make' will recompile the
+object files `kbd.o', `command.o' and `files.o' and then link the file
+`edit'.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Variables Simplify,  Next: make Deduces,  Prev: How Make Works,  Up: Introduction
+
+2.4 Variables Make Makefiles Simpler
+====================================
+
+In our example, we had to list all the object files twice in the rule
+for `edit' (repeated here):
+
+     edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+             cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+                        insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+   Such duplication is error-prone; if a new object file is added to the
+system, we might add it to one list and forget the other.  We can
+eliminate the risk and simplify the makefile by using a variable.
+"Variables" allow a text string to be defined once and substituted in
+multiple places later (*note How to Use Variables: Using Variables.).
+
+   It is standard practice for every makefile to have a variable named
+`objects', `OBJECTS', `objs', `OBJS', `obj', or `OBJ' which is a list
+of all object file names.  We would define such a variable `objects'
+with a line like this in the makefile:
+
+     objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+               insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+Then, each place we want to put a list of the object file names, we can
+substitute the variable's value by writing `$(objects)' (*note How to
+Use Variables: Using Variables.).
+
+   Here is how the complete simple makefile looks when you use a
+variable for the object files:
+
+     objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+               insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+     edit : $(objects)
+             cc -o edit $(objects)
+     main.o : main.c defs.h
+             cc -c main.c
+     kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
+             cc -c kbd.c
+     command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
+             cc -c command.c
+     display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
+             cc -c display.c
+     insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h
+             cc -c insert.c
+     search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h

+
+2.5 Letting `make' Deduce the Recipes
+=====================================
+
+It is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the
+individual C source files, because `make' can figure them out: it has an
+"implicit rule" for updating a `.o' file from a correspondingly named
+`.c' file using a `cc -c' command.  For example, it will use the recipe
+`cc -c main.c -o main.o' to compile `main.c' into `main.o'.  We can
+therefore omit the recipes from the rules for the object files.  *Note
+Using Implicit Rules: Implicit Rules.
+
+   When a `.c' file is used automatically in this way, it is also
+automatically added to the list of prerequisites.  We can therefore omit
+the `.c' files from the prerequisites, provided we omit the recipe.
+
+   Here is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a
+variable `objects' as suggested above:
+
+     objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+               insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+     edit : $(objects)
+             cc -o edit $(objects)
+
+     main.o : defs.h
+     kbd.o : defs.h command.h
+     command.o : defs.h command.h
+     display.o : defs.h buffer.h
+     insert.o : defs.h buffer.h
+     search.o : defs.h buffer.h
+     files.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h
+     utils.o : defs.h
+
+     .PHONY : clean
+     clean :
+             rm edit $(objects)
+
+This is how we would write the makefile in actual practice.  (The
+complications associated with `clean' are described elsewhere.  See
+*note Phony Targets::, and *note Errors in Recipes: Errors.)
+
+   Because implicit rules are so convenient, they are important.  You
+will see them used frequently.

+
+2.6 Another Style of Makefile
+=============================
+
+When the objects of a makefile are created only by implicit rules, an
+alternative style of makefile is possible.  In this style of makefile,
+you group entries by their prerequisites instead of by their targets.
+Here is what one looks like:
+
+     objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
+               insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
+
+     edit : $(objects)
+             cc -o edit $(objects)
+
+     $(objects) : defs.h
+     kbd.o command.o files.o : command.h
+     display.o insert.o search.o files.o : buffer.h
+
+Here `defs.h' is given as a prerequisite of all the object files;
+`command.h' and `buffer.h' are prerequisites of the specific object
+files listed for them.
+
+   Whether this is better is a matter of taste: it is more compact, but
+some people dislike it because they find it clearer to put all the
+information about each target in one place.

+
+2.7 Rules for Cleaning the Directory
+====================================
+
+Compiling a program is not the only thing you might want to write rules
+for.  Makefiles commonly tell how to do a few other things besides
+compiling a program: for example, how to delete all the object files
+and executables so that the directory is `clean'.
+
+   Here is how we could write a `make' rule for cleaning our example
+editor:
+
+     clean:
+             rm edit $(objects)
+
+   In practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more
+complicated manner to handle unanticipated situations.  We would do
+this:
+
+     .PHONY : clean
+     clean :
+             -rm edit $(objects)
+
+This prevents `make' from getting confused by an actual file called
+`clean' and causes it to continue in spite of errors from `rm'.  (See
+*note Phony Targets::, and *note Errors in Recipes: Errors.)
+
+A rule such as this should not be placed at the beginning of the
+makefile, because we do not want it to run by default!  Thus, in the
+example makefile, we want the rule for `edit', which recompiles the
+editor, to remain the default goal.
+
+   Since `clean' is not a prerequisite of `edit', this rule will not
+run at all if we give the command `make' with no arguments.  In order
+to make the rule run, we have to type `make clean'.  *Note How to Run
+`make': Running.

+
+3.1 What Makefiles Contain
+==========================
+
+Makefiles contain five kinds of things: "explicit rules", "implicit
+rules", "variable definitions", "directives", and "comments".  Rules,
+variables, and directives are described at length in later chapters.
+
+   * An "explicit rule" says when and how to remake one or more files,
+     called the rule's "targets".  It lists the other files that the
+     targets depend on, called the "prerequisites" of the target, and
+     may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets.
+     *Note Writing Rules: Rules.
+
+   * An "implicit rule" says when and how to remake a class of files
+     based on their names.  It describes how a target may depend on a
+     file with a name similar to the target and gives a recipe to
+     create or update such a target.  *Note Using Implicit Rules:
+     Implicit Rules.
+
+   * A "variable definition" is a line that specifies a text string
+     value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later.
+     The simple makefile example shows a variable definition for
+     `objects' as a list of all object files (*note Variables Make
+     Makefiles Simpler: Variables Simplify.).
+
+   * A "directive" is an instruction for `make' to do something special
+     while reading the makefile.  These include:
+
+        * Reading another makefile (*note Including Other Makefiles:
+          Include.).
+
+        * Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or
+          ignore a part of the makefile (*note Conditional Parts of
+          Makefiles: Conditionals.).
+
+        * Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing
+          multiple lines (*note Defining Multi-Line Variables:
+          Multi-Line.).
+
+   * `#' in a line of a makefile starts a "comment".  It and the rest
+     of the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash not
+     escaped by another backslash will continue the comment across
+     multiple lines.  A line containing just a comment (with perhaps
+     spaces before it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.  If you
+     want a literal `#', escape it with a backslash (e.g., `\#').
+     Comments may appear on any line in the makefile, although they are
+     treated specially in certain situations.
+
+     You cannot use comments within variable references or function
+     calls: any instance of `#' will be treated literally (rather than
+     as the start of a comment) inside a variable reference or function
+     call.
+
+     Comments within a recipe are passed to the shell, just as with any
+     other recipe text.  The shell decides how to interpret it: whether
+     or not this is a comment is up to the shell.
+
+     Within a `define' directive, comments are not ignored during the
+     definition of the variable, but rather kept intact in the value of
+     the variable.  When the variable is expanded they will either be
+     treated as `make' comments or as recipe text, depending on the
+     context in which the variable is evaluated.

+File: make.info,  Node: Splitting Lines,  Prev: Makefile Contents,  Up: Makefile Contents
+
+3.1.1 Splitting Long Lines
+--------------------------
+
+Makefiles use a "line-based" syntax in which the newline character is
+special and marks the end of a statement.  GNU `make' has no limit on
+the length of a statement line, up to the amount of memory in your
+computer.
+
+   However, it is difficult to read lines which are too long to display
+without wrapping or scrolling.  So, you can format your makefiles for
+readability by adding newlines into the middle of a statement: you do
+this by escaping the internal newlines with a backslash (`\')
+character.  Where we need to make a distinction we will refer to
+"physical lines" as a single line ending with a newline (regardless of
+whether it is escaped) and a "logical line" being a complete statement
+including all escaped newlines up to the first non-escaped newline.
+
+   The way in which backslash/newline combinations are handled depends
+on whether the statement is a recipe line or a non-recipe line.
+Handling of backslash/newline in a recipe line is discussed later
+(*note Splitting Recipe Lines::).
+
+   Outside of recipe lines, backslash/newlines are converted into a
+single space character.  Once that is done, all whitespace around the
+backslash/newline is condensed into a single space: this includes all
+whitespace preceding the backslash, all whitespace at the beginning of
+the line after the backslash/newline, and any consecutive
+backslash/newline combinations.
+
+   If the `.POSIX' special target is defined then backslash/newline
+handling is modified slightly to conform to POSIX.2: first, whitespace
+preceding a backslash is not removed and second, consecutive
+backslash/newlines are not condensed.

+
+3.2 What Name to Give Your Makefile
+===================================
+
+By default, when `make' looks for the makefile, it tries the following
+names, in order: `GNUmakefile', `makefile' and `Makefile'.  
+
+   Normally you should call your makefile either `makefile' or
+`Makefile'.  (We recommend `Makefile' because it appears prominently
+near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important
+files such as `README'.)  The first name checked, `GNUmakefile', is not
+recommended for most makefiles.  You should use this name if you have a
+makefile that is specific to GNU `make', and will not be understood by
+other versions of `make'.  Other `make' programs look for `makefile' and
+`Makefile', but not `GNUmakefile'.
+
+   If `make' finds none of these names, it does not use any makefile.
+Then you must specify a goal with a command argument, and `make' will
+attempt to figure out how to remake it using only its built-in implicit
+rules.  *Note Using Implicit Rules: Implicit Rules.
+
+   If you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can
+specify the makefile name with the `-f' or `--file' option.  The
+arguments `-f NAME' or `--file=NAME' tell `make' to read the file NAME
+as the makefile.  If you use more than one `-f' or `--file' option, you
+can specify several makefiles.  All the makefiles are effectively
+concatenated in the order specified.  The default makefile names
+`GNUmakefile', `makefile' and `Makefile' are not checked automatically
+if you specify `-f' or `--file'.  
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Include,  Next: MAKEFILES Variable,  Prev: Makefile Names,  Up: Makefiles
+
+3.3 Including Other Makefiles
+=============================
+
+The `include' directive tells `make' to suspend reading the current
+makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing.  The
+directive is a line in the makefile that looks like this:
+
+     include FILENAMES...
+
+FILENAMES can contain shell file name patterns.  If FILENAMES is empty,
+nothing is included and no error is printed.  
+
+   Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line,
+but the first character must not be a tab (or the value of
+`.RECIPEPREFIX')--if the line begins with a tab, it will be considered
+a recipe line.  Whitespace is required between `include' and the file
+names, and between file names; extra whitespace is ignored there and at
+the end of the directive.  A comment starting with `#' is allowed at
+the end of the line.  If the file names contain any variable or
+function references, they are expanded.  *Note How to Use Variables:
+Using Variables.
+
+   For example, if you have three `.mk' files, `a.mk', `b.mk', and
+`c.mk', and `$(bar)' expands to `bish bash', then the following
+expression
+
+     include foo *.mk $(bar)
+
+   is equivalent to
+
+     include foo a.mk b.mk c.mk bish bash
+
+   When `make' processes an `include' directive, it suspends reading of
+the containing makefile and reads from each listed file in turn.  When
+that is finished, `make' resumes reading the makefile in which the
+directive appears.
+
+   One occasion for using `include' directives is when several programs,
+handled by individual makefiles in various directories, need to use a
+common set of variable definitions (*note Setting Variables: Setting.)
+or pattern rules (*note Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules: Pattern
+Rules.).
+
+   Another such occasion is when you want to generate prerequisites from
+source files automatically; the prerequisites can be put in a file that
+is included by the main makefile.  This practice is generally cleaner
+than that of somehow appending the prerequisites to the end of the main
+makefile as has been traditionally done with other versions of `make'.
+*Note Automatic Prerequisites::.  
+
+   If the specified name does not start with a slash, and the file is
+not found in the current directory, several other directories are
+searched.  First, any directories you have specified with the `-I' or
+`--include-dir' option are searched (*note Summary of Options: Options
+Summary.).  Then the following directories (if they exist) are
+searched, in this order: `PREFIX/include' (normally `/usr/local/include'
+(1)) `/usr/gnu/include', `/usr/local/include', `/usr/include'.
+
+   If an included makefile cannot be found in any of these directories,
+a warning message is generated, but it is not an immediately fatal
+error; processing of the makefile containing the `include' continues.
+Once it has finished reading makefiles, `make' will try to remake any
+that are out of date or don't exist.  *Note How Makefiles Are Remade:
+Remaking Makefiles.  Only after it has tried to find a way to remake a
+makefile and failed, will `make' diagnose the missing makefile as a
+fatal error.
+
+   If you want `make' to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist
+or cannot be remade, with no error message, use the `-include'
+directive instead of `include', like this:
+
+     -include FILENAMES...
+
+   This acts like `include' in every way except that there is no error
+(not even a warning) if any of the FILENAMES (or any prerequisites of
+any of the FILENAMES) do not exist or cannot be remade.
+
+   For compatibility with some other `make' implementations, `sinclude'
+is another name for `-include'.

+
+3.4 The Variable `MAKEFILES'
+============================
+
+If the environment variable `MAKEFILES' is defined, `make' considers
+its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of additional
+makefiles to be read before the others.  This works much like the
+`include' directive: various directories are searched for those files
+(*note Including Other Makefiles: Include.).  In addition, the default
+goal is never taken from one of these makefiles (or any makefile
+included by them) and it is not an error if the files listed in
+`MAKEFILES' are not found.
+
+   The main use of `MAKEFILES' is in communication between recursive
+invocations of `make' (*note Recursive Use of `make': Recursion.).  It
+usually is not desirable to set the environment variable before a
+top-level invocation of `make', because it is usually better not to
+mess with a makefile from outside.  However, if you are running `make'
+without a specific makefile, a makefile in `MAKEFILES' can do useful
+things to help the built-in implicit rules work better, such as
+defining search paths (*note Directory Search::).
+
+   Some users are tempted to set `MAKEFILES' in the environment
+automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done.
+This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if
+run by anyone else.  It is much better to write explicit `include'
+directives in the makefiles.  *Note Including Other Makefiles: Include.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Remaking Makefiles,  Next: Overriding Makefiles,  Prev: MAKEFILES Variable,  Up: Makefiles
+
+3.5 How Makefiles Are Remade
+============================
+
+Sometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS
+files.  If a makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want
+`make' to get an up-to-date version of the makefile to read in.
+
+   To this end, after reading in all makefiles, `make' will consider
+each as a goal target and attempt to update it.  If a makefile has a
+rule which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile or
+in another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (*note Using
+Implicit Rules: Implicit Rules.), it will be updated if necessary.
+After all makefiles have been checked, if any have actually been
+changed, `make' starts with a clean slate and reads all the makefiles
+over again.  (It will also attempt to update each of them over again,
+but normally this will not change them again, since they are already up
+to date.)
+
+   If you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and
+you want to keep `make' from performing an implicit rule search on
+them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you can use any normal method of
+preventing implicit rule look-up to do so.  For example, you can write
+an explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty recipe
+(*note Using Empty Recipes: Empty Recipes.).
+
+   If the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with a
+recipe but no prerequisites, that file will always be remade (*note
+Double-Colon::).  In the case of makefiles, a makefile that has a
+double-colon rule with a recipe but no prerequisites will be remade
+every time `make' is run, and then again after `make' starts over and
+reads the makefiles in again.  This would cause an infinite loop:
+`make' would constantly remake the makefile, and never do anything
+else.  So, to avoid this, `make' will *not* attempt to remake makefiles
+which are specified as targets of a double-colon rule with a recipe but
+no prerequisites.
+
+   If you do not specify any makefiles to be read with `-f' or `--file'
+options, `make' will try the default makefile names; *note What Name to
+Give Your Makefile: Makefile Names.  Unlike makefiles explicitly
+requested with `-f' or `--file' options, `make' is not certain that
+these makefiles should exist.  However, if a default makefile does not
+exist but can be created by running `make' rules, you probably want the
+rules to be run so that the makefile can be used.
+
+   Therefore, if none of the default makefiles exists, `make' will try
+to make each of them in the same order in which they are searched for
+(*note What Name to Give Your Makefile: Makefile Names.)  until it
+succeeds in making one, or it runs out of names to try.  Note that it
+is not an error if `make' cannot find or make any makefile; a makefile
+is not always necessary.
+
+   When you use the `-t' or `--touch' option (*note Instead of
+Executing Recipes: Instead of Execution.), you would not want to use an
+out-of-date makefile to decide which targets to touch.  So the `-t'
+option has no effect on updating makefiles; they are really updated
+even if `-t' is specified.  Likewise, `-q' (or `--question') and `-n'
+(or `--just-print') do not prevent updating of makefiles, because an
+out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets.
+Thus, `make -f mfile -n foo' will update `mfile', read it in, and then
+print the recipe to update `foo' and its prerequisites without running
+it.  The recipe printed for `foo' will be the one specified in the
+updated contents of `mfile'.
+
+   However, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of
+even the makefiles.  You can do this by specifying the makefiles as
+goals in the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles.
+When the makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options
+`-t' and so on do apply to them.
+
+   Thus, `make -f mfile -n mfile foo' would read the makefile `mfile',
+print the recipe needed to update it without actually running it, and
+then print the recipe needed to update `foo' without running that.  The
+recipe for `foo' will be the one specified by the existing contents of
+`mfile'.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Overriding Makefiles,  Next: Reading Makefiles,  Prev: Remaking Makefiles,  Up: Makefiles
+
+3.6 Overriding Part of Another Makefile
+=======================================
+
+Sometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like
+another makefile.  You can often use the `include' directive to include
+one in the other, and add more targets or variable definitions.
+However, it is invalid for two makefiles to give different recipes for
+the same target.  But there is another way.
+
+   In the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other),
+you can use a match-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any
+target that cannot be made from the information in the containing
+makefile, `make' should look in another makefile.  *Note Pattern
+Rules::, for more information on pattern rules.
+
+   For example, if you have a makefile called `Makefile' that says how
+to make the target `foo' (and other targets), you can write a makefile
+called `GNUmakefile' that contains:
+
+     foo:
+             frobnicate > foo
+
+     %: force
+             @$(MAKE) -f Makefile $@
+     force: ;
+
+   If you say `make foo', `make' will find `GNUmakefile', read it, and
+see that to make `foo', it needs to run the recipe `frobnicate > foo'.
+If you say `make bar', `make' will find no way to make `bar' in
+`GNUmakefile', so it will use the recipe from the pattern rule: `make
+-f Makefile bar'.  If `Makefile' provides a rule for updating `bar',
+`make' will apply the rule.  And likewise for any other target that
+`GNUmakefile' does not say how to make.
+
+   The way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just
+`%', so it matches any target whatever.  The rule specifies a
+prerequisite `force', to guarantee that the recipe will be run even if
+the target file already exists.  We give the `force' target an empty
+recipe to prevent `make' from searching for an implicit rule to build
+it--otherwise it would apply the same match-anything rule to `force'
+itself and create a prerequisite loop!

+
+3.7 How `make' Reads a Makefile
+===============================
+
+GNU `make' does its work in two distinct phases.  During the first
+phase it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and
+internalizes all the variables and their values, implicit and explicit
+rules, and constructs a dependency graph of all the targets and their
+prerequisites.  During the second phase, `make' uses these internal
+structures to determine what targets will need to be rebuilt and to
+invoke the rules necessary to do so.
+
+   It's important to understand this two-phase approach because it has a
+direct impact on how variable and function expansion happens; this is
+often a source of some confusion when writing makefiles.  Here we will
+present a summary of the phases in which expansion happens for different
+constructs within the makefile.  We say that expansion is "immediate"
+if it happens during the first phase: in this case `make' will expand
+any variables or functions in that section of a construct as the
+makefile is parsed.  We say that expansion is "deferred" if expansion
+is not performed immediately.  Expansion of a deferred construct is not
+performed until either the construct appears later in an immediate
+context, or until the second phase.
+
+   You may not be familiar with some of these constructs yet.  You can
+reference this section as you become familiar with them, in later
+chapters.
+
+Variable Assignment
+-------------------
+
+Variable definitions are parsed as follows:
+
+     IMMEDIATE = DEFERRED
+     IMMEDIATE ?= DEFERRED
+     IMMEDIATE := IMMEDIATE
+     IMMEDIATE ::= IMMEDIATE
+     IMMEDIATE += DEFERRED or IMMEDIATE
+     IMMEDIATE != IMMEDIATE
+
+     define IMMEDIATE
+       DEFERRED
+     endef
+
+     define IMMEDIATE =
+       DEFERRED
+     endef
+
+     define IMMEDIATE ?=
+       DEFERRED
+     endef
+
+     define IMMEDIATE :=
+       IMMEDIATE
+     endef
+
+     define IMMEDIATE ::=
+       IMMEDIATE
+     endef
+
+     define IMMEDIATE +=
+       DEFERRED or IMMEDIATE
+     endef
+
+     define IMMEDIATE !=
+       IMMEDIATE
+     endef
+
+   For the append operator, `+=', the right-hand side is considered
+immediate if the variable was previously set as a simple variable (`:='
+or `::='), and deferred otherwise.
+
+   For the shell assignment operator, `!=', the right-hand side is
+evaluated immediately and handed to the shell.  The result is stored in
+the variable named on the left, and that variable becomes a simple
+variable (and will thus be re-evaluated on each reference).
+
+Conditional Directives
+----------------------
+
+Conditional directives are parsed immediately.  This means, for
+example, that automatic variables cannot be used in conditional
+directives, as automatic variables are not set until the recipe for
+that rule is invoked.  If you need to use automatic variables in a
+conditional directive you _must_ move the condition into the recipe and
+use shell conditional syntax instead.
+
+Rule Definition
+---------------
+
+A rule is always expanded the same way, regardless of the form:
+
+     IMMEDIATE : IMMEDIATE ; DEFERRED
+     	DEFERRED
+
+   That is, the target and prerequisite sections are expanded
+immediately, and the recipe used to construct the target is always
+deferred.  This general rule is true for explicit rules, pattern rules,
+suffix rules, static pattern rules, and simple prerequisite definitions.

+
+3.8 Secondary Expansion
+=======================
+
+In the previous section we learned that GNU `make' works in two
+distinct phases: a read-in phase and a target-update phase (*note How
+`make' Reads a Makefile: Reading Makefiles.).  GNU make also has the
+ability to enable a _second expansion_ of the prerequisites (only) for
+some or all targets defined in the makefile.  In order for this second
+expansion to occur, the special target `.SECONDEXPANSION' must be
+defined before the first prerequisite list that makes use of this
+feature.
+
+   If that special target is defined then in between the two phases
+mentioned above, right at the end of the read-in phase, all the
+prerequisites of the targets defined after the special target are
+expanded a _second time_.  In most circumstances this secondary
+expansion will have no effect, since all variable and function
+references will have been expanded during the initial parsing of the
+makefiles.  In order to take advantage of the secondary expansion phase
+of the parser, then, it's necessary to _escape_ the variable or
+function reference in the makefile.  In this case the first expansion
+merely un-escapes the reference but doesn't expand it, and expansion is
+left to the secondary expansion phase.  For example, consider this
+makefile:
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+     ONEVAR = onefile
+     TWOVAR = twofile
+     myfile: $(ONEVAR) $$(TWOVAR)
+
+   After the first expansion phase the prerequisites list of the
+`myfile' target will be `onefile' and `$(TWOVAR)'; the first
+(unescaped) variable reference to ONEVAR is expanded, while the second
+(escaped) variable reference is simply unescaped, without being
+recognized as a variable reference.  Now during the secondary expansion
+the first word is expanded again but since it contains no variable or
+function references it remains the value `onefile', while the second
+word is now a normal reference to the variable TWOVAR, which is
+expanded to the value `twofile'.  The final result is that there are
+two prerequisites, `onefile' and `twofile'.
+
+   Obviously, this is not a very interesting case since the same result
+could more easily have been achieved simply by having both variables
+appear, unescaped, in the prerequisites list.  One difference becomes
+apparent if the variables are reset; consider this example:
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+     AVAR = top
+     onefile: $(AVAR)
+     twofile: $$(AVAR)
+     AVAR = bottom
+
+   Here the prerequisite of `onefile' will be expanded immediately, and
+resolve to the value `top', while the prerequisite of `twofile' will
+not be full expanded until the secondary expansion and yield a value of
+`bottom'.
+
+   This is marginally more exciting, but the true power of this feature
+only becomes apparent when you discover that secondary expansions
+always take place within the scope of the automatic variables for that
+target.  This means that you can use variables such as `$@', `$*', etc.
+during the second expansion and they will have their expected values,
+just as in the recipe.  All you have to do is defer the expansion by
+escaping the `$'.  Also, secondary expansion occurs for both explicit
+and implicit (pattern) rules.  Knowing this, the possible uses for this
+feature increase dramatically.  For example:
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+     main_OBJS := main.o try.o test.o
+     lib_OBJS := lib.o api.o
+
+     main lib: $$($$@_OBJS)
+
+   Here, after the initial expansion the prerequisites of both the
+`main' and `lib' targets will be `$($@_OBJS)'.  During the secondary
+expansion, the `$@' variable is set to the name of the target and so
+the expansion for the `main' target will yield `$(main_OBJS)', or
+`main.o try.o test.o', while the secondary expansion for the `lib'
+target will yield `$(lib_OBJS)', or `lib.o api.o'.
+
+   You can also mix in functions here, as long as they are properly
+escaped:
+
+     main_SRCS := main.c try.c test.c
+     lib_SRCS := lib.c api.c
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+     main lib: $$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$$($$@_SRCS))
+
+   This version allows users to specify source files rather than object
+files, but gives the same resulting prerequisites list as the previous
+example.
+
+   Evaluation of automatic variables during the secondary expansion
+phase, especially of the target name variable `$$@', behaves similarly
+to evaluation within recipes.  However, there are some subtle
+differences and "corner cases" which come into play for the different
+types of rule definitions that `make' understands.  The subtleties of
+using the different automatic variables are described below.
+
+Secondary Expansion of Explicit Rules
+-------------------------------------
+
+During the secondary expansion of explicit rules, `$$@' and `$$%'
+evaluate, respectively, to the file name of the target and, when the
+target is an archive member, the target member name.  The `$$<'
+variable evaluates to the first prerequisite in the first rule for this
+target.  `$$^' and `$$+' evaluate to the list of all prerequisites of
+rules _that have already appeared_ for the same target (`$$+' with
+repetitions and `$$^' without).  The following example will help
+illustrate these behaviors:
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+
+     foo: foo.1 bar.1 $$< $$^ $$+    # line #1
+
+     foo: foo.2 bar.2 $$< $$^ $$+    # line #2
+
+     foo: foo.3 bar.3 $$< $$^ $$+    # line #3
+
+   In the first prerequisite list, all three variables (`$$<', `$$^',
+and `$$+') expand to the empty string.  In the second, they will have
+values `foo.1', `foo.1 bar.1', and `foo.1 bar.1' respectively.  In the
+third they will have values `foo.1', `foo.1 bar.1 foo.2 bar.2', and
+`foo.1 bar.1 foo.2 bar.2 foo.1 foo.1 bar.1 foo.1 bar.1' respectively.
+
+   Rules undergo secondary expansion in makefile order, except that the
+rule with the recipe is always evaluated last.
+
+   The variables `$$?' and `$$*' are not available and expand to the
+empty string.
+
+Secondary Expansion of Static Pattern Rules
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Rules for secondary expansion of static pattern rules are identical to
+those for explicit rules, above, with one exception: for static pattern
+rules the `$$*' variable is set to the pattern stem.  As with explicit
+rules, `$$?' is not available and expands to the empty string.
+
+Secondary Expansion of Implicit Rules
+-------------------------------------
+
+As `make' searches for an implicit rule, it substitutes the stem and
+then performs secondary expansion for every rule with a matching target
+pattern.  The value of the automatic variables is derived in the same
+fashion as for static pattern rules.  As an example:
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+
+     foo: bar
+
+     foo foz: fo%: bo%
+
+     %oo: $$< $$^ $$+ $$*
+
+   When the implicit rule is tried for target `foo', `$$<' expands to
+`bar', `$$^' expands to `bar boo', `$$+' also expands to `bar boo', and
+`$$*' expands to `f'.
+
+   Note that the directory prefix (D), as described in *note Implicit
+Rule Search Algorithm: Implicit Rule Search, is appended (after
+expansion) to all the patterns in the prerequisites list.  As an
+example:
+
+     .SECONDEXPANSION:
+
+     /tmp/foo.o:
+
+     %.o: $$(addsuffix /%.c,foo bar) foo.h
+             @echo $^
+
+   The prerequisite list printed, after the secondary expansion and
+directory prefix reconstruction, will be `/tmp/foo/foo.c /tmp/bar/foo.c
+foo.h'.  If you are not interested in this reconstruction, you can use
+`$$*' instead of `%' in the prerequisites list.

+
+4 Writing Rules
+***************
+
+A "rule" appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake
+certain files, called the rule's "targets" (most often only one per
+rule).  It lists the other files that are the "prerequisites" of the
+target, and the "recipe" to use to create or update the target.
+
+   The order of rules is not significant, except for determining the
+"default goal": the target for `make' to consider, if you do not
+otherwise specify one.  The default goal is the target of the first
+rule in the first makefile.  If the first rule has multiple targets,
+only the first target is taken as the default.  There are two
+exceptions: a target starting with a period is not a default unless it
+contains one or more slashes, `/', as well; and, a target that defines
+a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal.  (*Note Defining and
+Redefining Pattern Rules: Pattern Rules.)
+
+   Therefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is
+the one for compiling the entire program or all the programs described
+by the makefile (often with a target called `all').  *Note Arguments to
+Specify the Goals: Goals.

+4.1 Rule Example
+================
+
+Here is an example of a rule:
+
+     foo.o : foo.c defs.h       # module for twiddling the frobs
+             cc -c -g foo.c
+
+   Its target is `foo.o' and its prerequisites are `foo.c' and
+`defs.h'.  It has one command in the recipe: `cc -c -g foo.c'.  The
+recipe starts with a tab to identify it as a recipe.
+
+   This rule says two things:
+
+   * How to decide whether `foo.o' is out of date: it is out of date if
+     it does not exist, or if either `foo.c' or `defs.h' is more recent
+     than it.
+
+   * How to update the file `foo.o': by running `cc' as stated.  The
+     recipe does not explicitly mention `defs.h', but we presume that
+     `foo.c' includes it, and that that is why `defs.h' was added to
+     the prerequisites.

+File: make.info,  Node: Rule Syntax,  Next: Prerequisite Types,  Prev: Rule Example,  Up: Rules
+
+4.2 Rule Syntax
+===============
+
+In general, a rule looks like this:
+
+     TARGETS : PREREQUISITES
+             RECIPE
+             ...
+
+or like this:
+
+     TARGETS : PREREQUISITES ; RECIPE
+             RECIPE
+             ...
+
+   The TARGETS are file names, separated by spaces.  Wildcard
+characters may be used (*note Using Wildcard Characters in File Names:
+Wildcards.) and a name of the form `A(M)' represents member M in
+archive file A (*note Archive Members as Targets: Archive Members.).
+Usually there is only one target per rule, but occasionally there is a
+reason to have more (*note Multiple Targets in a Rule: Multiple
+Targets.).
+
+   The RECIPE lines start with a tab character (or the first character
+in the value of the `.RECIPEPREFIX' variable; *note Special
+Variables::).  The first recipe line may appear on the line after the
+prerequisites, with a tab character, or may appear on the same line,
+with a semicolon.  Either way, the effect is the same.  There are other
+differences in the syntax of recipes.  *Note Writing Recipes in Rules:
+Recipes.
+
+   Because dollar signs are used to start `make' variable references,
+if you really want a dollar sign in a target or prerequisite you must
+write two of them, `$$' (*note How to Use Variables: Using Variables.).
+If you have enabled secondary expansion (*note Secondary Expansion::)
+and you want a literal dollar sign in the prerequisites list, you must
+actually write _four_ dollar signs (`$$$$').
+
+   You may split a long line by inserting a backslash followed by a
+newline, but this is not required, as `make' places no limit on the
+length of a line in a makefile.
+
+   A rule tells `make' two things: when the targets are out of date,
+and how to update them when necessary.
+
+   The criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the
+PREREQUISITES, which consist of file names separated by spaces.
+(Wildcards and archive members (*note Archives::) are allowed here too.)
+A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any
+of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times).  The
+idea is that the contents of the target file are computed based on
+information in the prerequisites, so if any of the prerequisites
+changes, the contents of the existing target file are no longer
+necessarily valid.
+
+   How to update is specified by a RECIPE.  This is one or more lines
+to be executed by the shell (normally `sh'), but with some extra
+features (*note Writing Recipes in Rules: Recipes.).
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Prerequisite Types,  Next: Wildcards,  Prev: Rule Syntax,  Up: Rules
+
+4.3 Types of Prerequisites
+==========================
+
+There are actually two different types of prerequisites understood by
+GNU `make': normal prerequisites such as described in the previous
+section, and "order-only" prerequisites.  A normal prerequisite makes
+two statements: first, it imposes an order in which recipes will be
+invoked: the recipes for all prerequisites of a target will be
+completed before the recipe for the target is run.  Second, it imposes
+a dependency relationship: if any prerequisite is newer than the
+target, then the target is considered out-of-date and must be rebuilt.
+
+   Normally, this is exactly what you want: if a target's prerequisite
+is updated, then the target should also be updated.
+
+   Occasionally, however, you have a situation where you want to impose
+a specific ordering on the rules to be invoked _without_ forcing the
+target to be updated if one of those rules is executed.  In that case,
+you want to define "order-only" prerequisites.  Order-only
+prerequisites can be specified by placing a pipe symbol (`|') in the
+prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the pipe symbol
+are normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only:
+
+     TARGETS : NORMAL-PREREQUISITES | ORDER-ONLY-PREREQUISITES
+
+   The normal prerequisites section may of course be empty.  Also, you
+may still declare multiple lines of prerequisites for the same target:
+they are appended appropriately (normal prerequisites are appended to
+the list of normal prerequisites; order-only prerequisites are appended
+to the list of order-only prerequisites).  Note that if you declare the
+same file to be both a normal and an order-only prerequisite, the
+normal prerequisite takes precedence (since they have a strict superset
+of the behavior of an order-only prerequisite).
+
+   Consider an example where your targets are to be placed in a separate
+directory, and that directory might not exist before `make' is run.  In
+this situation, you want the directory to be created before any targets
+are placed into it but, because the timestamps on directories change
+whenever a file is added, removed, or renamed, we certainly don't want
+to rebuild all the targets whenever the directory's timestamp changes.
+One way to manage this is with order-only prerequisites: make the
+directory an order-only prerequisite on all the targets:
+
+     OBJDIR := objdir
+     OBJS := $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/,foo.o bar.o baz.o)
+
+     $(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
+             $(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $<
+
+     all: $(OBJS)
+
+     $(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)
+
+     $(OBJDIR):
+             mkdir $(OBJDIR)
+
+   Now the rule to create the `objdir' directory will be run, if
+needed, before any `.o' is built, but no `.o' will be built because the
+`objdir' directory timestamp changed.
+

+
+4.4 Using Wildcard Characters in File Names
+===========================================
+
+A single file name can specify many files using "wildcard characters".
+The wildcard characters in `make' are `*', `?' and `[...]', the same as
+in the Bourne shell.  For example, `*.c' specifies a list of all the
+files (in the working directory) whose names end in `.c'.
+
+   The character `~' at the beginning of a file name also has special
+significance.  If alone, or followed by a slash, it represents your home
+directory.  For example `~/bin' expands to `/home/you/bin'.  If the `~'
+is followed by a word, the string represents the home directory of the
+user named by that word.  For example `~john/bin' expands to
+`/home/john/bin'.  On systems which don't have a home directory for
+each user (such as MS-DOS or MS-Windows), this functionality can be
+simulated by setting the environment variable HOME.
+
+   Wildcard expansion is performed by `make' automatically in targets
+and in prerequisites.  In recipes, the shell is responsible for
+wildcard expansion.  In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens only
+if you request it explicitly with the `wildcard' function.
+
+   The special significance of a wildcard character can be turned off by
+preceding it with a backslash.  Thus, `foo\*bar' would refer to a
+specific file whose name consists of `foo', an asterisk, and `bar'.

+
+File: make.info,  Node: Wildcard Examples,  Next: Wildcard Pitfall,  Prev: Wildcards,  Up: Wildcards
+
+4.4.1 Wildcard Examples
+-----------------------
+
+Wildcards can be used in the recipe of a rule, where they are expanded
+by the shell.  For example, here is a rule to delete all the object
+files:
+
+     clean:
+             rm -f *.o
+
+   Wildcards are also useful in the prerequisites of a rule.  With the
+following rule in the makefile, `make print' will print all the `.c'
+files that have changed since the last time you printed them:
+
+     print: *.c
+             lpr -p $?
+             touch print
+
+This rule uses `print' as an empty target file; see *note Empty Target
+Files to Record Events: Empty Targets.  (The automatic variable `$?' is
+used to print only those files that have changed; see *note Automatic
+Variables::.)
+
+   Wildcard expansion does not happen when you define a variable.
+Thus, if you write this:
+
+     objects = *.o
+
+then the value of the variable `objects' is the actual string `*.o'.
+However, if you use the value of `objects' in a target or prerequisite,
+wildcard expansion will take place there.  If you use the value of
+`objects' in a recipe, the shell may perform wildcard expansion when
+the recipe runs.  To set `objects' to the expansion, instead use:
+
+     objects := $(wildcard *.o)
+
+*Note Wildcard Function::.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Wildcard Pitfall,  Next: Wildcard Function,  Prev: Wildcard Examples,  Up: Wildcards
+
+4.4.2 Pitfalls of Using Wildcards
+---------------------------------
+
+Now here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that
+does not do what you would intend.  Suppose you would like to say that
+the executable file `foo' is made from all the object files in the
+directory, and you write this:
+
+     objects = *.o
+
+     foo : $(objects)
+             cc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)
+
+The value of `objects' is the actual string `*.o'.  Wildcard expansion
+happens in the rule for `foo', so that each _existing_ `.o' file
+becomes a prerequisite of `foo' and will be recompiled if necessary.
+
+   But what if you delete all the `.o' files?  When a wildcard matches
+no files, it is left as it is, so then `foo' will depend on the
+oddly-named file `*.o'.  Since no such file is likely to exist, `make'
+will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to make `*.o'.
+This is not what you want!
+
+   Actually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard
+expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the
+`wildcard' function and string substitution.  *Note The Function
+`wildcard': Wildcard Function.
+
+   Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes
+to separate directories in pathnames, like so:
+
+       c:\foo\bar\baz.c
+
+   This is equivalent to the Unix-style `c:/foo/bar/baz.c' (the `c:'
+part is the so-called drive letter).  When `make' runs on these
+systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-style forward
+slashes in pathnames.  However, this support does _not_ include the
+wildcard expansion, where backslash is a quote character.  Therefore,
+you _must_ use Unix-style slashes in these cases.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Wildcard Function,  Prev: Wildcard Pitfall,  Up: Wildcards
+
+4.4.3 The Function `wildcard'
+-----------------------------
+
+Wildcard expansion happens automatically in rules.  But wildcard
+expansion does not normally take place when a variable is set, or
+inside the arguments of a function.  If you want to do wildcard
+expansion in such places, you need to use the `wildcard' function, like
+this:
+
+     $(wildcard PATTERN...)
+
+This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a
+space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the
+given file name patterns.  If no existing file name matches a pattern,
+then that pattern is omitted from the output of the `wildcard'
+function.  Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards
+behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored
+(*note Wildcard Pitfall::).
+
+   One use of the `wildcard' function is to get a list of all the C
+source files in a directory, like this:
+
+     $(wildcard *.c)
+
+   We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files
+by replacing the `.c' suffix with `.o' in the result, like this:
+
+     $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
+
+(Here we have used another function, `patsubst'.  *Note Functions for
+String Substitution and Analysis: Text Functions.)
+
+   Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and
+then link them together could be written as follows:
+
+     objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
+
+     foo : $(objects)
+             cc -o foo $(objects)
+
+(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so
+there is no need to write explicit rules for compiling the files.
+*Note The Two Flavors of Variables: Flavors, for an explanation of
+`:=', which is a variant of `='.)

+===========================================
+
+For large systems, it is often desirable to put sources in a separate
+directory from the binaries.  The "directory search" features of `make'
+facilitate this by searching several directories automatically to find
+a prerequisite.  When you redistribute the files among directories, you
+do not need to change the individual rules, just the search paths.

+
+4.5.1 `VPATH': Search Path for All Prerequisites
+------------------------------------------------
+
+The value of the `make' variable `VPATH' specifies a list of
+directories that `make' should search.  Most often, the directories are
+expected to contain prerequisite files that are not in the current
+directory; however, `make' uses `VPATH' as a search list for both
+prerequisites and targets of rules.
+
+   Thus, if a file that is listed as a target or prerequisite does not
+exist in the current directory, `make' searches the directories listed
+in `VPATH' for a file with that name.  If a file is found in one of
+them, that file may become the prerequisite (see below).  Rules may then
+specify the names of files in the prerequisite list as if they all
+existed in the current directory.  *Note Writing Recipes with Directory
+Search: Recipes/Search.
+
+   In the `VPATH' variable, directory names are separated by colons or
+blanks.  The order in which directories are listed is the order followed
+by `make' in its search.  (On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, semi-colons are
+used as separators of directory names in `VPATH', since the colon can
+be used in the pathname itself, after the drive letter.)
+
+   For example,
+
+     VPATH = src:../headers
+
+specifies a path containing two directories, `src' and `../headers',
+which `make' searches in that order.
+
+   With this value of `VPATH', the following rule,
+
+     foo.o : foo.c
+
+is interpreted as if it were written like this:
+
+     foo.o : src/foo.c
+
+assuming the file `foo.c' does not exist in the current directory but
+is found in the directory `src'.

+
+4.5.2 The `vpath' Directive
+---------------------------
+
+Similar to the `VPATH' variable, but more selective, is the `vpath'
+directive (note lower case), which allows you to specify a search path
+for a particular class of file names: those that match a particular
+pattern.  Thus you can supply certain search directories for one class
+of file names and other directories (or none) for other file names.
+
+   There are three forms of the `vpath' directive:
+
+`vpath PATTERN DIRECTORIES'
+     Specify the search path DIRECTORIES for file names that match
+     PATTERN.
+
+     The search path, DIRECTORIES, is a list of directories to be
+     searched, separated by colons (semi-colons on MS-DOS and
+     MS-Windows) or blanks, just like the search path used in the
+     `VPATH' variable.
+
+`vpath PATTERN'
+     Clear out the search path associated with PATTERN.
+
+`vpath'
+     Clear all search paths previously specified with `vpath'
+     directives.
+
+   A `vpath' pattern is a string containing a `%' character.  The
+string must match the file name of a prerequisite that is being searched
+for, the `%' character matching any sequence of zero or more characters
+(as in pattern rules; *note Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules:
+Pattern Rules.).  For example, `%.h' matches files that end in `.h'.
+(If there is no `%', the pattern must match the prerequisite exactly,
+which is not useful very often.)
+
+   `%' characters in a `vpath' directive's pattern can be quoted with
+preceding backslashes (`\').  Backslashes that would otherwise quote
+`%' characters can be quoted with more backslashes.  Backslashes that
+quote `%' characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern
+before it is compared to file names.  Backslashes that are not in
+danger of quoting `%' characters go unmolested.
+
+   When a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the
+PATTERN in a `vpath' directive matches the name of the prerequisite
+file, then the DIRECTORIES in that directive are searched just like
+(and before) the directories in the `VPATH' variable.
+
+   For example,
+
+     vpath %.h ../headers
+
+tells `make' to look for any prerequisite whose name ends in `.h' in
+the directory `../headers' if the file is not found in the current
+directory.
+
+   If several `vpath' patterns match the prerequisite file's name, then
+`make' processes each matching `vpath' directive one by one, searching
+all the directories mentioned in each directive.  `make' handles
+multiple `vpath' directives in the order in which they appear in the
+makefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are independent of
+each other.
+
+   Thus,
+
+     vpath %.c foo
+     vpath %   blish
+     vpath %.c bar
+
+will look for a file ending in `.c' in `foo', then `blish', then `bar',
+while
+
+     vpath %.c foo:bar
+     vpath %   blish
+
+will look for a file ending in `.c' in `foo', then `bar', then `blish'.

+
+4.5.3 How Directory Searches are Performed
+------------------------------------------
+
+When a prerequisite is found through directory search, regardless of
+type (general or selective), the pathname located may not be the one
+that `make' actually provides you in the prerequisite list.  Sometimes
+the path discovered through directory search is thrown away.
+
+   The algorithm `make' uses to decide whether to keep or abandon a
+path found via directory search is as follows:
+
+  1. If a target file does not exist at the path specified in the
+     makefile, directory search is performed.
+
+  2. If the directory search is successful, that path is kept and this
+     file is tentatively stored as the target.
+
+  3. All prerequisites of this target are examined using this same
+     method.
+
+  4. After processing the prerequisites, the target may or may not need
+     to be rebuilt:
+
+       a. If the target does _not_ need to be rebuilt, the path to the
+          file found during directory search is used for any
+          prerequisite lists which contain this target.  In short, if
+          `make' doesn't need to rebuild the target then you use the
+          path found via directory search.
+
+       b. If the target _does_ need to be rebuilt (is out-of-date), the
+          pathname found during directory search is _thrown away_, and
+          the target is rebuilt using the file name specified in the
+          makefile.  In short, if `make' must rebuild, then the target
+          is rebuilt locally, not in the directory found via directory
+          search.
+
+   This algorithm may seem complex, but in practice it is quite often
+exactly what you want.
+
+   Other versions of `make' use a simpler algorithm: if the file does
+not exist, and it is found via directory search, then that pathname is
+always used whether or not the target needs to be built.  Thus, if the
+target is rebuilt it is created at the pathname discovered during
+directory search.
+
+   If, in fact, this is the behavior you want for some or all of your
+directories, you can use the `GPATH' variable to indicate this to
+`make'.
+
+   `GPATH' has the same syntax and format as `VPATH' (that is, a space-
+or colon-delimited list of pathnames).  If an out-of-date target is
+found by directory search in a directory that also appears in `GPATH',
+then that pathname is not thrown away.  The target is rebuilt using the
+expanded path.

+
+4.5.4 Writing Recipes with Directory Search
+-------------------------------------------
+
+When a prerequisite is found in another directory through directory
+search, this cannot change the recipe of the rule; they will execute as
+written.  Therefore, you must write the recipe with care so that it
+will look for the prerequisite in the directory where `make' finds it.
+
+   This is done with the "automatic variables" such as `$^' (*note
+Automatic Variables::).  For instance, the value of `$^' is a list of
+all the prerequisites of the rule, including the names of the
+directories in which they were found, and the value of `$@' is the
+target.  Thus:
+
+     foo.o : foo.c
+             cc -c $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@
+
+(The variable `CFLAGS' exists so you can specify flags for C
+compilation by implicit rules; we use it here for consistency so it will
+affect all C compilations uniformly; *note Variables Used by Implicit
+Rules: Implicit Variables.)
+
+   Often the prerequisites include header files as well, which you do
+not want to mention in the recipe.  The automatic variable `$<' is just
+the first prerequisite:
+
+     VPATH = src:../headers
+     foo.o : foo.c defs.h hack.h
+             cc -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
+

+
+4.5.5 Directory Search and Implicit Rules
+-----------------------------------------
+
+The search through the directories specified in `VPATH' or with `vpath'
+also happens during consideration of implicit rules (*note Using
+Implicit Rules: Implicit Rules.).
+
+   For example, when a file `foo.o' has no explicit rule, `make'
+considers implicit rules, such as the built-in rule to compile `foo.c'
+if that file exists.  If such a file is lacking in the current
+directory, the appropriate directories are searched for it.  If `foo.c'
+exists (or is mentioned in the makefile) in any of the directories, the
+implicit rule for C compilation is applied.
+
+   The recipes of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a
+matter of necessity; consequently they will use the file names found by
+directory search with no extra effort.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Libraries/Search,  Prev: Implicit/Search,  Up: Directory Search
+
+4.5.6 Directory Search for Link Libraries
+-----------------------------------------
+
+Directory search applies in a special way to libraries used with the
+linker.  This special feature comes into play when you write a
+prerequisite whose name is of the form `-lNAME'.  (You can tell
+something strange is going on here because the prerequisite is normally
+the name of a file, and the _file name_ of a library generally looks
+like `libNAME.a', not like `-lNAME'.)
+
+   When a prerequisite's name has the form `-lNAME', `make' handles it
+specially by searching for the file `libNAME.so', and, if it is not
+found, for the file `libNAME.a' in the current directory, in
+directories specified by matching `vpath' search paths and the `VPATH'
+search path, and then in the directories `/lib', `/usr/lib', and
+`PREFIX/lib' (normally `/usr/local/lib', but MS-DOS/MS-Windows versions
+of `make' behave as if PREFIX is defined to be the root of the DJGPP
+installation tree).
+
+   For example, if there is a `/usr/lib/libcurses.a' library on your
+system (and no `/usr/lib/libcurses.so' file), then
+
+     foo : foo.c -lcurses
+             cc $^ -o $@
+
+would cause the command `cc foo.c /usr/lib/libcurses.a -o foo' to be
+executed when `foo' is older than `foo.c' or than
+`/usr/lib/libcurses.a'.
+
+   Although the default set of files to be searched for is `libNAME.so'
+and `libNAME.a', this is customizable via the `.LIBPATTERNS' variable.
+Each word in the value of this variable is a pattern string.  When a
+prerequisite like `-lNAME' is seen, `make' will replace the percent in
+each pattern in the list with NAME and perform the above directory
+searches using each library file name.
+
+   The default value for `.LIBPATTERNS' is `lib%.so lib%.a', which
+provides the default behavior described above.
+
+   You can turn off link library expansion completely by setting this
+variable to an empty value.

+
+4.6 Phony Targets
+=================
+
+A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it
+is just a name for a recipe to be executed when you make an explicit
+request.  There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a
+conflict with a file of the same name, and to improve performance.
+
+   If you write a rule whose recipe will not create the target file, the
+recipe will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking.
+Here is an example:
+
+     clean:
+             rm *.o temp
+
+Because the `rm' command does not create a file named `clean', probably
+no such file will ever exist.  Therefore, the `rm' command will be
+executed every time you say `make clean'.  
+
+   The phony target will cease to work if anything ever does create a
+file named `clean' in this directory.  Since it has no prerequisites,
+the file `clean' would inevitably be considered up to date, and its
+recipe would not be executed.  To avoid this problem, you can explicitly
+declare the target to be phony, using the special target `.PHONY'
+(*note Special Built-in Target Names: Special Targets.) as follows:
+
+     .PHONY : clean
+
+Once this is done, `make clean' will run the recipe regardless of
+whether there is a file named `clean'.
+
+   Since it knows that phony targets do not name actual files that
+could be remade from other files, `make' skips the implicit rule search
+for phony targets (*note Implicit Rules::).  This is why declaring a
+target phony is good for performance, even if you are not worried about
+the actual file existing.
+
+   Thus, you first write the line that states that `clean' is a phony
+target, then you write the rule, like this:
+
+     .PHONY: clean
+     clean:
+             rm *.o temp
+
+   Another example of the usefulness of phony targets is in conjunction
+with recursive invocations of `make' (for more information, see *note
+Recursive Use of `make': Recursion.).  In this case the makefile will
+often contain a variable which lists a number of sub-directories to be
+built.  One way to handle this is with one rule whose recipe is a shell
+loop over the sub-directories, like this:
+
+     SUBDIRS = foo bar baz
+
+     subdirs:
+             for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
+               $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \
+             done
+
+   There are problems with this method, however.  First, any error
+detected in a sub-make is ignored by this rule, so it will continue to
+build the rest of the directories even when one fails.  This can be
+overcome by adding shell commands to note the error and exit, but then
+it will do so even if `make' is invoked with the `-k' option, which is
+unfortunate.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, you cannot take
+advantage of `make''s ability to build targets in parallel (*note
+Parallel Execution: Parallel.), since there is only one rule.
+
+   By declaring the sub-directories as phony targets (you must do this
+as the sub-directory obviously always exists; otherwise it won't be
+built) you can remove these problems:
+
+     SUBDIRS = foo bar baz
+
+     .PHONY: subdirs $(SUBDIRS)
+
+     subdirs: $(SUBDIRS)
+
+     $(SUBDIRS):
+             $(MAKE) -C $@
+
+     foo: baz
+
+   Here we've also declared that the `foo' sub-directory cannot be
+built until after the `baz' sub-directory is complete; this kind of
+relationship declaration is particularly important when attempting
+parallel builds.
+
+   A phony target should not be a prerequisite of a real target file;
+if it is, its recipe will be run every time `make' goes to update that
+file.  As long as a phony target is never a prerequisite of a real
+target, the phony target recipe will be executed only when the phony
+target is a specified goal (*note Arguments to Specify the Goals:
+Goals.).
+
+   Phony targets can have prerequisites.  When one directory contains
+multiple programs, it is most convenient to describe all of the
+programs in one makefile `./Makefile'.  Since the target remade by
+default will be the first one in the makefile, it is common to make
+this a phony target named `all' and give it, as prerequisites, all the
+individual programs.  For example:
+
+     all : prog1 prog2 prog3
+     .PHONY : all
+
+     prog1 : prog1.o utils.o
+             cc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o
+
+     prog2 : prog2.o
+             cc -o prog2 prog2.o
+
+     prog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o
+             cc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o
+
+Now you can say just `make' to remake all three programs, or specify as
+arguments the ones to remake (as in `make prog1 prog3').  Phoniness is
+not inherited: the prerequisites of a phony target are not themselves
+phony, unless explicitly declared to be so.
+
+   When one phony target is a prerequisite of another, it serves as a
+subroutine of the other.  For example, here `make cleanall' will delete
+the object files, the difference files, and the file `program':
+
+     .PHONY: cleanall cleanobj cleandiff
+
+     cleanall : cleanobj cleandiff
+             rm program
+
+     cleanobj :
+             rm *.o
+
+     cleandiff :
+             rm *.diff

+
+4.7 Rules without Recipes or Prerequisites
+==========================================
+
+If a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule is
+a nonexistent file, then `make' imagines this target to have been
+updated whenever its rule is run.  This implies that all targets
+depending on this one will always have their recipe run.
+
+   An example will illustrate this:
+
+     clean: FORCE
+             rm $(objects)
+     FORCE:
+
+   Here the target `FORCE' satisfies the special conditions, so the
+target `clean' that depends on it is forced to run its recipe.  There
+is nothing special about the name `FORCE', but that is one name
+commonly used this way.
+
+   As you can see, using `FORCE' this way has the same results as using
+`.PHONY: clean'.
+
+   Using `.PHONY' is more explicit and more efficient.  However, other
+versions of `make' do not support `.PHONY'; thus `FORCE' appears in
+many makefiles.  *Note Phony Targets::.
+

+File: make.info,  Node: Empty Targets,  Next: Special Targets,  Prev: Force Targets,  Up: Rules
+
+4.8 Empty Target Files to Record Events
+=======================================
+
+The "empty target" is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold
+recipes for an action that you request explicitly from time to time.
+Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file's
+contents do not matter, and usually are empty.
+
+   The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its
+last-modification time, when the rule's recipe was last executed.  It
+does so because one of the commands in the recipe is a `touch' command
+to update the target file.
+
+   The empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it
+doesn't make sense).  When you ask to remake the empty target, the
+recipe is executed if any prerequisite is more recent than the target;
+in other words, if a prerequisite has changed since the last time you
+remade the target.  Here is an example:
+
+     print: foo.c bar.c
+             lpr -p $?
+             touch print
+   
+With this rule, `make print' will execute the `lpr' command if either
+source file has changed since the last `make print'.  The automatic
+variable `$?' is used to print only those files that have changed
+(*note Automatic Variables::).

+
+4.9 Special Built-in Target Names
+=================================
+
+Certain names have special meanings if they appear as targets.
+
+`.PHONY'
+     The prerequisites of the special target `.PHONY' are considered to
+     be phony targets.  When it is time to consider such a target,
+     `make' will run its recipe unconditionally, regardless of whether
+     a file with that name exists or what its last-modification time
+     is.  *Note Phony Targets: Phony Targets.
+
+`.SUFFIXES'
+     The prerequisites of the special target `.SUFFIXES' are the list
+     of suffixes to be used in checking for suffix rules.  *Note
+     Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules.
+
+`.DEFAULT'
+     The recipe specified for `.DEFAULT' is used for any target for
+     which no rules are found (either explicit rules or implicit rules).
+     *Note Last Resort::.  If a `.DEFAULT' recipe is specified, every
+     file mentioned as a prerequisite, but not as a target in a rule,
+     will have that recipe executed on its behalf.  *Note Implicit Rule
+     Search Algorithm: Implicit Rule Search.
+
+`.PRECIOUS'
+     The targets which `.PRECIOUS' depends on are given the following
+     special treatment: if `make' is killed or interrupted during the
+     execution of their recipes, the target is not deleted.  *Note
+     Interrupting or Killing `make': Interrupts.  Also, if the target
+     is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no
+     longer needed, as is normally done.  *Note Chains of Implicit
+     Rules: Chained Rules.  In this latter respect it overlaps with the
+     `.SECONDARY' special target.
+
+     You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as
+     `%.o') as a prerequisite file of the special target `.PRECIOUS' to
+     preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target patterns
+     match that file's name.
+
+`.INTERMEDIATE'
+     The targets which `.INTERMEDIATE' depends on are treated as
+     intermediate files.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.
+     `.INTERMEDIATE' with no prerequisites has no effect.
+
+`.SECONDARY'
+     The targets which `.SECONDARY' depends on are treated as
+     intermediate files, except that they are never automatically
+     deleted.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.
+
+     `.SECONDARY' with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated
+     as secondary (i.e., no target is removed because it is considered
+     intermediate).
+
+`.SECONDEXPANSION'
+     If `.SECONDEXPANSION' is mentioned as a target anywhere in the
+     makefile, then all prerequisite lists defined _after_ it appears
+     will be expanded a second time after all makefiles have been read
+     in.  *Note Secondary Expansion: Secondary Expansion.
+
+`.DELETE_ON_ERROR'
+     If `.DELETE_ON_ERROR' is mentioned as a target anywhere in the
+     makefile, then `make' will delete the target of a rule if it has
+     changed and its recipe exits with a nonzero exit status, just as it
+     does when it receives a signal.  *Note Errors in Recipes: Errors.
+
+`.IGNORE'
+     If you specify prerequisites for `.IGNORE', then `make' will
+     ignore errors in execution of the recipe for those particular
+     files.  The recipe for `.IGNORE' (if any) is ignored.
+
+     If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, `.IGNORE' says to
+     ignore errors in execution of recipes for all files.  This usage of
+     `.IGNORE' is supported only for historical compatibility.  Since
+     this affects every recipe in the makefile, it is not very useful;
+     we recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in
+     specific recipes.  *Note Errors in Recipes: Errors.
+
+`.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME'
+     If you specify prerequisites for `.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME', `make'
+     assumes that these files are created by commands that generate low
+     resolution time stamps.  The recipe for the `.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME'
+     target are ignored.
+
+     The high resolution file time stamps of many modern file systems
+     lessen the chance of `make' incorrectly concluding that a file is
+     up to date.  Unfortunately, some hosts do not provide a way to set
+     a high resolution file time stamp, so commands like `cp -p' that
+     explicitly set a file's time stamp must discard its sub-second
+     part.  If a file is created by such a command, you should list it
+     as a prerequisite of `.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME' so that `make' does
+     not mistakenly conclude that the file is out of date.  For example:
+
+          .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME: dst
+          dst: src
+                  cp -p src dst
+
+     Since `cp -p' discards the sub-second part of `src''s time stamp,
+     `dst' is typically slightly older than `src' even when it is up to
+     date.  The `.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME' line causes `make' to consider
+     `dst' to be up to date if its time stamp is at the start of the
+     same second that `src''s time stamp is in.
+
+     Due to a limitation of the archive format, archive member time
+     stamps are always low resolution.  You need not list archive
+     members as prerequisites of `.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME', as `make' does
+     this automatically.
+
+`.SILENT'
+     If you specify prerequisites for `.SILENT', then `make' will not
+     print the recipe used to remake those particular files before
+     executing them.  The recipe for `.SILENT' is ignored.
+
+     If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, `.SILENT' says not
+     to print any recipes before executing them.  This usage of
+     `.SILENT' is supported only for historical compatibility.  We
+     recommend you use the more selective ways to silence specific
+     recipes.  *Note Recipe Echoing: Echoing.  If you want to silence
+     all recipes for a particular run of `make', use the `-s' or
+     `--silent' option (*note Options Summary::).
+
+`.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES'
+     Simply by being mentioned as a target, this tells `make' to export
+     all variables to child processes by default.  *Note Communicating
+     Variables to a Sub-`make': Variables/Recursion.
+
+`.NOTPARALLEL'
+     If `.NOTPARALLEL' is mentioned as a target, then this invocation
+     of `make' will be run serially, even if the `-j' option is given.
+     Any recursively invoked `make' command will still run recipes in
+     parallel (unless its makefile also contains this target).  Any
+     prerequisites on this target are ignored.
+
+`.ONESHELL'
+     If `.ONESHELL' is mentioned as a target, then when a target is
+     built all lines of the recipe will be given to a single invocation
+     of the shell rather than each line being invoked separately (*note
+     Recipe Execution: Execution.).
+
+`.POSIX'
+     If `.POSIX' is mentioned as a target, then the makefile will be
+     parsed and run in POSIX-conforming mode.  This does _not_ mean
+     that only POSIX-conforming makefiles will be accepted: all advanced
+     GNU `make' features are still available.  Rather, this target
+     causes `make' to behave as required by POSIX in those areas where
+     `make''s default behavior differs.
+
+     In particular, if this target is mentioned then recipes will be
+     invoked as if the shell had been passed the `-e' flag: the first
+     failing command in a recipe will cause the recipe to fail
+     immediately.
+
+   Any defined implicit rule suffix also counts as a special target if
+it appears as a target, and so does the concatenation of two suffixes,
+such as `.c.o'.  These targets are suffix rules, an obsolete way of
+defining implicit rules (but a way still widely used).  In principle,
+any target name could be special in this way if you break it in two and
+add both pieces to the suffix list.  In practice, suffixes normally
+begin with `.', so these special target names also begin with `.'.

+4.10 Multiple Targets in a Rule
+===============================
+
+A rule with multiple targets is equivalent to writing many rules, each
+with one target, and all identical aside from that.  The same recipe
+applies to all the targets, but its effect may vary because you can
+substitute the actual target name into the recipe using `$@'.  The rule
+contributes the same prerequisites to all the targets also.
+
+   This is useful in two cases.
+
+   * You want just prerequisites, no recipe.  For example:
+
+          kbd.o command.o files.o: command.h
+
+     gives an additional prerequisite to each of the three object files
+     mentioned.
+
+   * Similar recipes work for all the targets.  The recipes do not need
+     to be absolutely identical, since the automatic variable `$@' can
+     be used to substitute the particular target to be remade into the
+     commands (*note Automatic Variables::).  For example:
+
+          bigoutput littleoutput : text.g
+                  generate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) > $@
+     
+     is equivalent to
+
+          bigoutput : text.g
+                  generate text.g -big > bigoutput
+          littleoutput : text.g
+                  generate text.g -little > littleoutput
+
+     Here we assume the hypothetical program `generate' makes two types
+     of output, one if given `-big' and one if given `-little'.  *Note
+     Functions for String Substitution and Analysis: Text Functions,
+     for an explanation of the `subst' function.
+
+   Suppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the
+target, much as the variable `$@' allows you to vary the recipe.  You
+cannot do this with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you can
+do it with a "static pattern rule".  *Note Static Pattern Rules: Static
+Pattern.

+
+4.11 Multiple Rules for One Target
+==================================
+
+One file can be the target of several rules.  All the prerequisites
+mentioned in all the rules are merged into one list of prerequisites for
+the target.  If the target is older than any prerequisite from any rule,
+the recipe is executed.
+
+   There can only be one recipe to be executed for a file.  If more than
+one rule gives a recipe for the same file, `make' uses the last one
+given and prints an error message.  (As a special case, if the file's
+name begins with a dot, no error message is printed.  This odd behavior
+is only for compatibility with other implementations of `make'... you
+should avoid using it).  Occasionally it is useful to have the same
+target invoke multiple recipes which are defined in different parts of
+your makefile; you can use "double-colon rules" (*note Double-Colon::)
+for this.
+
+   An extra rule with just prerequisites can be used to give a few extra
+prerequisites to many files at once.  For example, makefiles often have
+a variable, such as `objects', containing a list of all the compiler
+output files in the system being made.  An easy way to say that all of
+them must be recompiled if `config.h' changes is to write the following:
+
+     objects = foo.o bar.o
+     foo.o : defs.h
+     bar.o : defs.h test.h
+     $(objects) : config.h
+
+   This could be inserted or taken out without changing the rules that
+really specify how to make the object files, making it a convenient
+form to use if you wish to add the additional prerequisite
+intermittently.
+
+   Another wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be
+specified with a variable that you set with a command line argument to
+`make' (*note Overriding Variables: Overriding.).  For example,
+
+     extradeps=
+     $(objects) : $(extradeps)
+
+means that the command `make extradeps=foo.h' will consider `foo.h' as
+a prerequisite of each object file, but plain `make' will not.
+
+   If none of the explicit rules for a target has a recipe, then `make'
+searches for an applicable implicit rule to find one *note Using
+Implicit Rules: Implicit Rules.).

+4.12 Static Pattern Rules
+=========================
+
+"Static pattern rules" are rules which specify multiple targets and
+construct the prerequisite names for each target based on the target
+name.  They are more general than ordinary rules with multiple targets
+because the targets do not have to have identical prerequisites.  Their
+prerequisites must be _analogous_, but not necessarily _identical_.

+
+4.12.1 Syntax of Static Pattern Rules
+-------------------------------------
+
+Here is the syntax of a static pattern rule:
+
+     TARGETS ...: TARGET-PATTERN: PREREQ-PATTERNS ...
+             RECIPE
+             ...
+
+The TARGETS list specifies the targets that the rule applies to.  The
+targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of
+ordinary rules (*note Using Wildcard Characters in File Names:
+Wildcards.).
+
+   The TARGET-PATTERN and PREREQ-PATTERNS say how to compute the
+prerequisites of each target.  Each target is matched against the
+TARGET-PATTERN to extract a part of the target name, called the "stem".
+This stem is substituted into each of the PREREQ-PATTERNS to make the
+prerequisite names (one from each PREREQ-PATTERN).
+
+   Each pattern normally contains the character `%' just once.  When the
+TARGET-PATTERN matches a target, the `%' can match any part of the
+target name; this part is called the "stem".  The rest of the pattern
+must match exactly.  For example, the target `foo.o' matches the
+pattern `%.o', with `foo' as the stem.  The targets `foo.c' and
+`foo.out' do not match that pattern.
+
+   The prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the
+stem for the `%' in each prerequisite pattern.  For example, if one
+prerequisite pattern is `%.c', then substitution of the stem `foo'
+gives the prerequisite name `foo.c'.  It is legitimate to write a
+prerequisite pattern that does not contain `%'; then this prerequisite
+is the same for all targets.
+
+   `%' characters in pattern rules can be quoted with preceding
+backslashes (`\').  Backslashes that would otherwise quote `%'
+characters can be quoted with more backslashes.  Backslashes that quote
+`%' characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before
+it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it.
+Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting `%' characters go
+unmolested.  For example, the pattern `the\%weird\\%pattern\\' has
+`the%weird\' preceding the operative `%' character, and `pattern\\'
+following it.  The final two backslashes are left alone because they
+cannot affect any `%' character.
+
+   Here is an example, which compiles each of `foo.o' and `bar.o' from
+the corresponding `.c' file:
+
+     objects = foo.o bar.o
+
+     all: $(objects)
+
+     $(objects): %.o: %.c
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
+
+Here `$<' is the automatic variable that holds the name of the
+prerequisite and `$@' is the automatic variable that holds the name of
+the target; see *note Automatic Variables::.
+
+   Each target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is
+issued for each target that does not.  If you have a list of files,
+only some of which will match the pattern, you can use the `filter'
+function to remove non-matching file names (*note Functions for String
+Substitution and Analysis: Text Functions.):
+
+     files = foo.elc bar.o lose.o
+
+     $(filter %.o,$(files)): %.o: %.c
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
+     $(filter %.elc,$(files)): %.elc: %.el
+             emacs -f batch-byte-compile $<
+
+In this example the result of `$(filter %.o,$(files))' is `bar.o
+lose.o', and the first static pattern rule causes each of these object
+files to be updated by compiling the corresponding C source file.  The
+result of `$(filter %.elc,$(files))' is `foo.elc', so that file is made
+from `foo.el'.
+
+   Another example shows how to use `$*' in static pattern rules: 
+
+     bigoutput littleoutput : %output : text.g
+             generate text.g -$* > $@
+
+When the `generate' command is run, `$*' will expand to the stem,
+either `big' or `little'.

+
+4.12.2 Static Pattern Rules versus Implicit Rules
+-------------------------------------------------
+
+A static pattern rule has much in common with an implicit rule defined
+as a pattern rule (*note Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules: Pattern
+Rules.).  Both have a pattern for the target and patterns for
+constructing the names of prerequisites.  The difference is in how
+`make' decides _when_ the rule applies.
+
+   An implicit rule _can_ apply to any target that matches its pattern,
+but it _does_ apply only when the target has no recipe otherwise
+specified, and only when the prerequisites can be found.  If more than
+one implicit rule appears applicable, only one applies; the choice
+depends on the order of rules.
+
+   By contrast, a static pattern rule applies to the precise list of
+targets that you specify in the rule.  It cannot apply to any other
+target and it invariably does apply to each of the targets specified.
+If two conflicting rules apply, and both have recipes, that's an error.
+
+   The static pattern rule can be better than an implicit rule for these
+reasons:
+
+   * You may wish to override the usual implicit rule for a few files
+     whose names cannot be categorized syntactically but can be given
+     in an explicit list.
+
+   * If you cannot be sure of the precise contents of the directories
+     you are using, you may not be sure which other irrelevant files
+     might lead `make' to use the wrong implicit rule.  The choice
+     might depend on the order in which the implicit rule search is
+     done.  With static pattern rules, there is no uncertainty: each
+     rule applies to precisely the targets specified.

+
+4.13 Double-Colon Rules
+=======================
+
+"Double-colon" rules are explicit rules written with `::' instead of
+`:' after the target names.  They are handled differently from ordinary
+rules when the same target appears in more than one rule.  Pattern
+rules with double-colons have an entirely different meaning (*note
+Match-Anything Rules::).
+
+   When a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the
+same type: all ordinary, or all double-colon.  If they are
+double-colon, each of them is independent of the others.  Each
+double-colon rule's recipe is executed if the target is older than any
+prerequisites of that rule.  If there are no prerequisites for that
+rule, its recipe is always executed (even if the target already
+exists).  This can result in executing none, any, or all of the
+double-colon rules.
+
+   Double-colon rules with the same target are in fact completely
+separate from one another.  Each double-colon rule is processed
+individually, just as rules with different targets are processed.
+
+   The double-colon rules for a target are executed in the order they
+appear in the makefile.  However, the cases where double-colon rules
+really make sense are those where the order of executing the recipes
+would not matter.
+
+   Double-colon rules are somewhat obscure and not often very useful;
+they provide a mechanism for cases in which the method used to update a
+target differs depending on which prerequisite files caused the update,
+and such cases are rare.
+
+   Each double-colon rule should specify a recipe; if it does not, an
+implicit rule will be used if one applies.  *Note Using Implicit Rules:
+Implicit Rules.

+
+4.14 Generating Prerequisites Automatically
+===========================================
+
+In the makefile for a program, many of the rules you need to write often
+say only that some object file depends on some header file.  For
+example, if `main.c' uses `defs.h' via an `#include', you would write:
+
+     main.o: defs.h
+
+You need this rule so that `make' knows that it must remake `main.o'
+whenever `defs.h' changes.  You can see that for a large program you
+would have to write dozens of such rules in your makefile.  And, you
+must always be very careful to update the makefile every time you add
+or remove an `#include'.  
+
+   To avoid this hassle, most modern C compilers can write these rules
+for you, by looking at the `#include' lines in the source files.
+Usually this is done with the `-M' option to the compiler.  For
+example, the command:
+
+     cc -M main.c
+
+generates the output:
+
+     main.o : main.c defs.h
+
+Thus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself.  The
+compiler will do it for you.
+
+   Note that such a rule constitutes mentioning `main.o' in a makefile,
+so it can never be considered an intermediate file by implicit rule
+search.  This means that `make' won't ever remove the file after using
+it; *note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.
+
+   With old `make' programs, it was traditional practice to use this
+compiler feature to generate prerequisites on demand with a command like
+`make depend'.  That command would create a file `depend' containing
+all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then the makefile could
+use `include' to read them in (*note Include::).
+
+   In GNU `make', the feature of remaking makefiles makes this practice
+obsolete--you need never tell `make' explicitly to regenerate the
+prerequisites, because it always regenerates any makefile that is out
+of date.  *Note Remaking Makefiles::.
+
+   The practice we recommend for automatic prerequisite generation is
+to have one makefile corresponding to each source file.  For each
+source file `NAME.c' there is a makefile `NAME.d' which lists what
+files the object file `NAME.o' depends on.  That way only the source
+files that have changed need to be rescanned to produce the new
+prerequisites.
+
+   Here is the pattern rule to generate a file of prerequisites (i.e.,
+a makefile) called `NAME.d' from a C source file called `NAME.c':
+
+     %.d: %.c
+             @set -e; rm -f $@; \
+              $(CC) -M $(CPPFLAGS) $< > $@.$$$$; \
+              sed 's,\($*\)\.o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' < $@.$$$$ > $@; \
+              rm -f $@.$$$$
+
+*Note Pattern Rules::, for information on defining pattern rules.  The
+`-e' flag to the shell causes it to exit immediately if the `$(CC)'
+command (or any other command) fails (exits with a nonzero status).  
+
+   With the GNU C compiler, you may wish to use the `-MM' flag instead
+of `-M'.  This omits prerequisites on system header files.  *Note
+Options Controlling the Preprocessor: (gcc)Preprocessor Options, for
+details.
+
+   The purpose of the `sed' command is to translate (for example):
+
+     main.o : main.c defs.h
+
+into:
+
+     main.o main.d : main.c defs.h
+
+This makes each `.d' file depend on all the source and header files
+that the corresponding `.o' file depends on.  `make' then knows it must
+regenerate the prerequisites whenever any of the source or header files
+changes.
+
+   Once you've defined the rule to remake the `.d' files, you then use
+the `include' directive to read them all in.  *Note Include::.  For
+example:
+
+     sources = foo.c bar.c
+
+     include $(sources:.c=.d)
+
+(This example uses a substitution variable reference to translate the
+list of source files `foo.c bar.c' into a list of prerequisite
+makefiles, `foo.d bar.d'.  *Note Substitution Refs::, for full
+information on substitution references.)  Since the `.d' files are
+makefiles like any others, `make' will remake them as necessary with no
+further work from you.  *Note Remaking Makefiles::.
+
+   Note that the `.d' files contain target definitions; you should be
+sure to place the `include' directive _after_ the first, default goal
+in your makefiles or run the risk of having a random object file become
+the default goal.  *Note How Make Works::.

+
+5.1 Recipe Syntax
+=================
+
+Makefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct
+syntaxes in one file.  Most of the makefile uses `make' syntax (*note
+Writing Makefiles: Makefiles.).  However, recipes are meant to be
+interpreted by the shell and so they are written using shell syntax.
+The `make' program does not try to understand shell syntax: it performs
+only a very few specific translations on the content of the recipe
+before handing it to the shell.
+
+   Each line in the recipe must start with a tab (or the first character
+in the value of the `.RECIPEPREFIX' variable; *note Special
+Variables::), except that the first recipe line may be attached to the
+target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between.  _Any_ line
+in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a "rule context"
+(that is, after a rule has been started until another rule or variable
+definition) will be considered part of a recipe for that rule.  Blank
+lines and lines of just comments may appear among the recipe lines;
+they are ignored.
+
+   Some consequences of these rules include:
+
+   * A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it's an empty
+     recipe (*note Empty Recipes::).
+
+   * A comment in a recipe is not a `make' comment; it will be passed
+     to the shell as-is.  Whether the shell treats it as a comment or
+     not depends on your shell.
+
+   * A variable definition in a "rule context" which is indented by a
+     tab as the first character on the line, will be considered part of
+     a recipe, not a `make' variable definition, and passed to the
+     shell.
+
+   * A conditional expression (`ifdef', `ifeq', etc. *note Syntax of
+     Conditionals: Conditional Syntax.) in a "rule context" which is
+     indented by a tab as the first character on the line, will be
+     considered part of a recipe and be passed to the shell.

+
+5.1.1 Splitting Recipe Lines
+----------------------------
+
+One of the few ways in which `make' does interpret recipes is checking
+for a backslash just before the newline.  As in normal makefile syntax,
+a single logical recipe line can be split into multiple physical lines
+in the makefile by placing a backslash before each newline.  A sequence
+of lines like this is considered a single recipe line, and one instance
+of the shell will be invoked to run it.
+
+   However, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a
+makefile (*note Splitting Long Lines: Splitting Lines.),
+backslash/newline pairs are _not_ removed from the recipe.  Both the
+backslash and the newline characters are preserved and passed to the
+shell.  How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your shell.
+If the first character of the next line after the backslash/newline is
+the recipe prefix character (a tab by default; *note Special
+Variables::), then that character (and only that character) is removed.
+Whitespace is never added to the recipe.
+
+   For example, the recipe for the all target in this makefile:
+
+     all :
+             @echo no\
+     space
+             @echo no\
+             space
+             @echo one \
+             space
+             @echo one\
+              space
+
+consists of four separate shell commands where the output is:
+
+     nospace
+     nospace
+     one space
+     one space
+
+   As a more complex example, this makefile:
+
+     all : ; @echo 'hello \
+             world' ; echo "hello \
+         world"
+
+will invoke one shell with a command of:
+
+     echo 'hello \
+     world' ; echo "hello \
+         world"
+
+which, according to shell quoting rules, will yield the following
+output:
+
+     hello \
+     world
+     hello     world
+
+Notice how the backslash/newline pair was removed inside the string
+quoted with double quotes (`"..."'), but not from the string quoted
+with single quotes (`'...'').  This is the way the default shell
+(`/bin/sh') handles backslash/newline pairs.  If you specify a
+different shell in your makefiles it may treat them differently.
+
+   Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but
+you don't want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content.
+This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl,
+where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning
+or even be a syntax error.  One simple way of handling this is to place
+the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a `make' variable
+then use the variable in the recipe.  In this situation the newline
+quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline
+will be removed.  If we rewrite our example above using this method:
+
+     HELLO = 'hello \
+     world'
+
+     all : ; @echo $(HELLO)
+
+we will get output like this:
+
+     hello world
+
+   If you like, you can also use target-specific variables (*note
+Target-specific Variable Values: Target-specific.) to obtain a tighter
+correspondence between the variable and the recipe that uses it.

+
+5.1.2 Using Variables in Recipes
+--------------------------------
+
+The other way in which `make' processes recipes is by expanding any
+variable references in them (*note Basics of Variable References:
+Reference.).  This occurs after make has finished reading all the
+makefiles and the target is determined to be out of date; so, the
+recipes for targets which are not rebuilt are never expanded.
+
+   Variable and function references in recipes have identical syntax and
+semantics to references elsewhere in the makefile.  They also have the
+same quoting rules: if you want a dollar sign to appear in your recipe,
+you must double it (`$$').  For shells like the default shell, that use
+dollar signs to introduce variables, it's important to keep clear in
+your mind whether the variable you want to reference is a `make'
+variable (use a single dollar sign) or a shell variable (use two dollar
+signs).  For example:
+
+     LIST = one two three
+     all:
+             for i in $(LIST); do \
+                 echo $$i; \
+             done
+
+results in the following command being passed to the shell:
+
+     for i in one two three; do \
+         echo $i; \
+     done
+
+which generates the expected result:
+
+     one
+     two
+     three

+File: make.info,  Node: Echoing,  Next: Execution,  Prev: Recipe Syntax,  Up: Recipes
+
+5.2 Recipe Echoing
+==================
+
+Normally `make' prints each line of the recipe before it is executed.
+We call this "echoing" because it gives the appearance that you are
+typing the lines yourself.
+
+   When a line starts with `@', the echoing of that line is suppressed.
+The `@' is discarded before the line is passed to the shell.  Typically
+you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
+something, such as an `echo' command to indicate progress through the
+makefile:
+
+     @echo About to make distribution files
+
+   When `make' is given the flag `-n' or `--just-print' it only echoes
+most recipes, without executing them.  *Note Summary of Options:
+Options Summary.  In this case even the recipe lines starting with `@'
+are printed.  This flag is useful for finding out which recipes `make'
+thinks are necessary without actually doing them.
+
+   The `-s' or `--silent' flag to `make' prevents all echoing, as if
+all recipes started with `@'.  A rule in the makefile for the special
+target `.SILENT' without prerequisites has the same effect (*note
+Special Built-in Target Names: Special Targets.).  `.SILENT' is
+essentially obsolete since `@' is more flexible.
+

+File: make.info,  Node: Execution,  Next: Parallel,  Prev: Echoing,  Up: Recipes
+
+5.3 Recipe Execution
+====================
+
+When it is time to execute recipes to update a target, they are
+executed by invoking a new sub-shell for each line of the recipe,
+unless the `.ONESHELL' special target is in effect (*note Using One
+Shell: One Shell.)  (In practice, `make' may take shortcuts that do not
+affect the results.)
+
+   *Please note:* this implies that setting shell variables and
+invoking shell commands such as `cd' that set a context local to each
+process will not affect the following lines in the recipe.(1)  If you
+want to use `cd' to affect the next statement, put both statements in a
+single recipe line.  Then `make' will invoke one shell to run the
+entire line, and the shell will execute the statements in sequence.
+For example:
+
+     foo : bar/lose
+             cd $(@D) && gobble $(@F) > ../$@
+
+Here we use the shell AND operator (`&&') so that if the `cd' command
+fails, the script will fail without trying to invoke the `gobble'
+command in the wrong directory, which could cause problems (in this
+case it would certainly cause `../foo' to be truncated, at least).

+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: One Shell,  Next: Choosing the Shell,  Prev: Execution,  Up: Execution
+
+5.3.1 Using One Shell
+---------------------
+
+Sometimes you would prefer that all the lines in the recipe be passed
+to a single invocation of the shell.  There are generally two
+situations where this is useful: first, it can improve performance in
+makefiles where recipes consist of many command lines, by avoiding
+extra processes.  Second, you might want newlines to be included in
+your recipe command (for example perhaps you are using a very different
+interpreter as your `SHELL').  If the `.ONESHELL' special target
+appears anywhere in the makefile then _all_ recipe lines for each
+target will be provided to a single invocation of the shell.  Newlines
+between recipe lines will be preserved.  For example:
+
+     .ONESHELL:
+     foo : bar/lose
+             cd $(@D)
+             gobble $(@F) > ../$@
+
+would now work as expected even though the commands are on different
+recipe lines.
+
+   If `.ONESHELL' is provided, then only the first line of the recipe
+will be checked for the special prefix characters (`@', `-', and `+').
+Subsequent lines will include the special characters in the recipe line
+when the `SHELL' is invoked.  If you want your recipe to start with one
+of these special characters you'll need to arrange for them to not be
+the first characters on the first line, perhaps by adding a comment or
+similar.  For example, this would be a syntax error in Perl because the
+first `@' is removed by make:
+
+     .ONESHELL:
+     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
+     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
+     show :
+             @f = qw(a b c);
+             print "@f\n";
+
+However, either of these alternatives would work properly:
+
+     .ONESHELL:
+     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
+     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
+     show :
+             # Make sure "@" is not the first character on the first line
+             @f = qw(a b c);
+             print "@f\n";
+
+or
+
+     .ONESHELL:
+     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
+     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
+     show :
+             my @f = qw(a b c);
+             print "@f\n";
+
+   As a special feature, if `SHELL' is determined to be a POSIX-style
+shell, the special prefix characters in "internal" recipe lines will
+_removed_ before the recipe is processed.  This feature is intended to
+allow existing makefiles to add the `.ONESHELL' special target and
+still run properly without extensive modifications.  Since the special
+prefix characters are not legal at the beginning of a line in a POSIX
+shell script this is not a loss in functionality.  For example, this
+works as expected:
+
+     .ONESHELL:
+     foo : bar/lose
+             @cd $(@D)
+             @gobble $(@F) > ../$@
+
+   Even with this special feature, however, makefiles with `.ONESHELL'
+will behave differently in ways that could be noticeable.  For example,
+normally if any line in the recipe fails, that causes the rule to fail
+and no more recipe lines are processed.  Under `.ONESHELL' a failure of
+any but the final recipe line will not be noticed by `make'.  You can
+modify `.SHELLFLAGS' to add the `-e' option to the shell which will
+cause any failure anywhere in the command line to cause the shell to
+fail, but this could itself cause your recipe to behave differently.
+Ultimately you may need to harden your recipe lines to allow them to
+work with `.ONESHELL'.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Choosing the Shell,  Prev: One Shell,  Up: Execution
+
+5.3.2 Choosing the Shell
+------------------------
+
+The program used as the shell is taken from the variable `SHELL'.  If
+this variable is not set in your makefile, the program `/bin/sh' is
+used as the shell.  The argument(s) passed to the shell are taken from
+the variable `.SHELLFLAGS'.  The default value of `.SHELLFLAGS' is `-c'
+normally, or `-ec' in POSIX-conforming mode.
+
+   Unlike most variables, the variable `SHELL' is never set from the
+environment.  This is because the `SHELL' environment variable is used
+to specify your personal choice of shell program for interactive use.
+It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect the
+functioning of makefiles.  *Note Variables from the Environment:
+Environment.
+
+   Furthermore, when you do set `SHELL' in your makefile that value is
+_not_ exported in the environment to recipe lines that `make' invokes.
+Instead, the value inherited from the user's environment, if any, is
+exported.  You can override this behavior by explicitly exporting
+`SHELL' (*note Communicating Variables to a Sub-`make':
+Variables/Recursion.), forcing it to be passed in the environment to
+recipe lines.
+
+   However, on MS-DOS and MS-Windows the value of `SHELL' in the
+environment *is* used, since on those systems most users do not set
+this variable, and therefore it is most likely set specifically to be
+used by `make'.  On MS-DOS, if the setting of `SHELL' is not suitable
+for `make', you can set the variable `MAKESHELL' to the shell that
+`make' should use; if set it will be used as the shell instead of the
+value of `SHELL'.
+
+Choosing a Shell in DOS and Windows
+...................................
+
+Choosing a shell in MS-DOS and MS-Windows is much more complex than on
+other systems.
+
+   On MS-DOS, if `SHELL' is not set, the value of the variable
+`COMSPEC' (which is always set) is used instead.
+
+   The processing of lines that set the variable `SHELL' in Makefiles
+is different on MS-DOS.  The stock shell, `command.com', is
+ridiculously limited in its functionality and many users of `make' tend
+to install a replacement shell.  Therefore, on MS-DOS, `make' examines
+the value of `SHELL', and changes its behavior based on whether it
+points to a Unix-style or DOS-style shell.  This allows reasonable
+functionality even if `SHELL' points to `command.com'.
+
+   If `SHELL' points to a Unix-style shell, `make' on MS-DOS
+additionally checks whether that shell can indeed be found; if not, it
+ignores the line that sets `SHELL'.  In MS-DOS, GNU `make' searches for
+the shell in the following places:
+
+  1. In the precise place pointed to by the value of `SHELL'.  For
+     example, if the makefile specifies `SHELL = /bin/sh', `make' will
+     look in the directory `/bin' on the current drive.
+
+  2. In the current directory.
+
+  3. In each of the directories in the `PATH' variable, in order.
+
+
+   In every directory it examines, `make' will first look for the
+specific file (`sh' in the example above).  If this is not found, it
+will also look in that directory for that file with one of the known
+extensions which identify executable files.  For example `.exe',
+`.com', `.bat', `.btm', `.sh', and some others.
+
+   If any of these attempts is successful, the value of `SHELL' will be
+set to the full pathname of the shell as found.  However, if none of
+these is found, the value of `SHELL' will not be changed, and thus the
+line that sets it will be effectively ignored.  This is so `make' will
+only support features specific to a Unix-style shell if such a shell is
+actually installed on the system where `make' runs.
+
+   Note that this extended search for the shell is limited to the cases
+where `SHELL' is set from the Makefile; if it is set in the environment
+or command line, you are expected to set it to the full pathname of the
+shell, exactly as things are on Unix.
+
+   The effect of the above DOS-specific processing is that a Makefile
+that contains `SHELL = /bin/sh' (as many Unix makefiles do), will work
+on MS-DOS unaltered if you have e.g. `sh.exe' installed in some
+directory along your `PATH'.
+

+File: make.info,  Node: Parallel,  Next: Errors,  Prev: Execution,  Up: Recipes
+
+5.4 Parallel Execution
+======================
+
+GNU `make' knows how to execute several recipes at once.  Normally,
+`make' will execute only one recipe at a time, waiting for it to finish
+before executing the next.  However, the `-j' or `--jobs' option tells
+`make' to execute many recipes simultaneously.  You can inhibit
+parallelism in a particular makefile with the `.NOTPARALLEL'
+pseudo-target (*note Special Built-in Target Names: Special Targets.).
+
+   On MS-DOS, the `-j' option has no effect, since that system doesn't
+support multi-processing.
+
+   If the `-j' option is followed by an integer, this is the number of
+recipes to execute at once; this is called the number of "job slots".
+If there is nothing looking like an integer after the `-j' option,
+there is no limit on the number of job slots.  The default number of job
+slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).
+
+   One unpleasant consequence of running several recipes simultaneously
+is that output generated by the recipes appears whenever each recipe
+sends it, so messages from different recipes may be interspersed.
+
+   Another problem is that two processes cannot both take input from the
+same device; so to make sure that only one recipe tries to take input
+from the terminal at once, `make' will invalidate the standard input
+streams of all but one running recipe.  This means that attempting to
+read from standard input will usually be a fatal error (a `Broken pipe'
+signal) for most child processes if there are several.  
+
+   It is unpredictable which recipe will have a valid standard input
+stream (which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the
+standard input of `make').  The first recipe run will always get it
+first, and the first recipe started after that one finishes will get it
+next, and so on.
+
+   We will change how this aspect of `make' works if we find a better
+alternative.  In the mean time, you should not rely on any recipe using
+standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature;
+but if you are not using this feature, then standard input works
+normally in all recipes.
+
+   Finally, handling recursive `make' invocations raises issues.  For
+more information on this, see *note Communicating Options to a
+Sub-`make': Options/Recursion.
+
+   If a recipe fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero
+status), and errors are not ignored for that recipe (*note Errors in
+Recipes: Errors.), the remaining recipe lines to remake the same target
+will not be run.  If a recipe fails and the `-k' or `--keep-going'
+option was not given (*note Summary of Options: Options Summary.),
+`make' aborts execution.  If make terminates for any reason (including
+a signal) with child processes running, it waits for them to finish
+before actually exiting.
+
+   When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run
+fewer jobs than when it is lightly loaded.  You can use the `-l' option
+to tell `make' to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the
+load average.  The `-l' or `--max-load' option is followed by a
+floating-point number.  For example,
+
+     -l 2.5
+
+will not let `make' start more than one job if the load average is
+above 2.5.  The `-l' option with no following number removes the load
+limit, if one was given with a previous `-l' option.
+
+   More precisely, when `make' goes to start up a job, and it already
+has at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it
+is not lower than the limit given with `-l', `make' waits until the load
+average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.
+
+   By default, there is no load limit.

+
+5.5 Errors in Recipes
+=====================
+
+After each shell invocation returns, `make' looks at its exit status.
+If the shell completed successfully (the exit status is zero), the next
+line in the recipe is executed in a new shell; after the last line is
+finished, the rule is finished.
+
+   If there is an error (the exit status is nonzero), `make' gives up on
+the current rule, and perhaps on all rules.
+
+   Sometimes the failure of a certain recipe line does not indicate a
+problem.  For example, you may use the `mkdir' command to ensure that a
+directory exists.  If the directory already exists, `mkdir' will report
+an error, but you probably want `make' to continue regardless.
+
+   To ignore errors in a recipe line, write a `-' at the beginning of
+the line's text (after the initial tab).  The `-' is discarded before
+the line is passed to the shell for execution.
+
+   For example,
+
+     clean:
+             -rm -f *.o
+
+This causes `make' to continue even if `rm' is unable to remove a file.
+
+   When you run `make' with the `-i' or `--ignore-errors' flag, errors
+are ignored in all recipes of all rules.  A rule in the makefile for
+the special target `.IGNORE' has the same effect, if there are no
+prerequisites.  These ways of ignoring errors are obsolete because `-'
+is more flexible.
+
+   When errors are to be ignored, because of either a `-' or the `-i'
+flag, `make' treats an error return just like success, except that it
+prints out a message that tells you the status code the shell exited
+with, and says that the error has been ignored.
+
+   When an error happens that `make' has not been told to ignore, it
+implies that the current target cannot be correctly remade, and neither
+can any other that depends on it either directly or indirectly.  No
+further recipes will be executed for these targets, since their
+preconditions have not been achieved.
+
+   Normally `make' gives up immediately in this circumstance, returning
+a nonzero status.  However, if the `-k' or `--keep-going' flag is
+specified, `make' continues to consider the other prerequisites of the
+pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and
+returns nonzero status.  For example, after an error in compiling one
+object file, `make -k' will continue compiling other object files even
+though it already knows that linking them will be impossible.  *Note
+Summary of Options: Options Summary.
+
+   The usual behavior assumes that your purpose is to get the specified
+targets up to date; once `make' learns that this is impossible, it
+might as well report the failure immediately.  The `-k' option says
+that the real purpose is to test as many of the changes made in the
+program as possible, perhaps to find several independent problems so
+that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This
+is why Emacs' `compile' command passes the `-k' flag by default.  
+
+   Usually when a recipe line fails, if it has changed the target file
+at all, the file is corrupted and cannot be used--or at least it is not
+completely updated.  Yet the file's time stamp says that it is now up to
+date, so the next time `make' runs, it will not try to update that
+file.  The situation is just the same as when the shell is killed by a
+signal; *note Interrupts::.  So generally the right thing to do is to
+delete the target file if the recipe fails after beginning to change
+the file.  `make' will do this if `.DELETE_ON_ERROR' appears as a
+target.  This is almost always what you want `make' to do, but it is
+not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly
+request it.
+

+
+5.6 Interrupting or Killing `make'
+==================================
+
+If `make' gets a fatal signal while a shell is executing, it may delete
+the target file that the recipe was supposed to update.  This is done
+if the target file's last-modification time has changed since `make'
+first checked it.
+
+   The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade
+from scratch when `make' is next run.  Why is this?  Suppose you type
+`Ctrl-c' while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an
+object file `foo.o'.  The `Ctrl-c' kills the compiler, resulting in an
+incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source
+file `foo.c'.  But `make' also receives the `Ctrl-c' signal and deletes
+this incomplete file.  If `make' did not do this, the next invocation
+of `make' would think that `foo.o' did not require updating--resulting
+in a strange error message from the linker when it tries to link an
+object file half of which is missing.
+
+   You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making
+the special target `.PRECIOUS' depend on it.  Before remaking a target,
+`make' checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of
+`.PRECIOUS', and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted
+if a signal happens.  Some reasons why you might do this are that the
+target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a
+modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all
+times to prevent other sorts of trouble.
+

+File: make.info,  Node: Recursion,  Next: Canned Recipes,  Prev: Interrupts,  Up: Recipes
+
+5.7 Recursive Use of `make'
+===========================
+
+Recursive use of `make' means using `make' as a command in a makefile.
+This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for various
+subsystems that compose a larger system.  For example, suppose you have
+a sub-directory `subdir' which has its own makefile, and you would like
+the containing directory's makefile to run `make' on the sub-directory.
+You can do it by writing this:
+
+     subsystem:
+             cd subdir && $(MAKE)
+
+or, equivalently, this (*note Summary of Options: Options Summary.):
+
+     subsystem:
+             $(MAKE) -C subdir
+   
+   You can write recursive `make' commands just by copying this example,
+but there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about
+how the sub-`make' relates to the top-level `make'.  You may also find
+it useful to declare targets that invoke recursive `make' commands as
+`.PHONY' (for more discussion on when this is useful, see *note Phony
+Targets::).
+
+   For your convenience, when GNU `make' starts (after it has processed
+any `-C' options) it sets the variable `CURDIR' to the pathname of the
+current working directory.  This value is never touched by `make'
+again: in particular note that if you include files from other
+directories the value of `CURDIR' does not change.  The value has the
+same precedence it would have if it were set in the makefile (by
+default, an environment variable `CURDIR' will not override this
+value).  Note that setting this variable has no impact on the operation
+of `make' (it does not cause `make' to change its working directory,
+for example).

+File: make.info,  Node: MAKE Variable,  Next: Variables/Recursion,  Prev: Recursion,  Up: Recursion
+
+5.7.1 How the `MAKE' Variable Works
+-----------------------------------
+
+Recursive `make' commands should always use the variable `MAKE', not
+the explicit command name `make', as shown here:
+
+     subsystem:
+             cd subdir && $(MAKE)
+
+   The value of this variable is the file name with which `make' was
+invoked.  If this file name was `/bin/make', then the recipe executed
+is `cd subdir && /bin/make'.  If you use a special version of `make' to
+run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be executed
+for recursive invocations.  
+
+   As a special feature, using the variable `MAKE' in the recipe of a
+rule alters the effects of the `-t' (`--touch'), `-n' (`--just-print'),
+or `-q' (`--question') option.  Using the `MAKE' variable has the same
+effect as using a `+' character at the beginning of the recipe line.
+*Note Instead of Executing the Recipes: Instead of Execution.  This
+special feature is only enabled if the `MAKE' variable appears directly
+in the recipe: it does not apply if the `MAKE' variable is referenced
+through expansion of another variable.  In the latter case you must use
+the `+' token to get these special effects.
+
+   Consider the command `make -t' in the above example.  (The `-t'
+option marks targets as up to date without actually running any
+recipes; see *note Instead of Execution::.)  Following the usual
+definition of `-t', a `make -t' command in the example would create a
+file named `subsystem' and do nothing else.  What you really want it to
+do is run `cd subdir && make -t'; but that would require executing the
+recipe, and `-t' says not to execute recipes.  
+
+   The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a recipe
+line of a rule contains the variable `MAKE', the flags `-t', `-n' and
+`-q' do not apply to that line.  Recipe lines containing `MAKE' are
+executed normally despite the presence of a flag that causes most
+recipes not to be run.  The usual `MAKEFLAGS' mechanism passes the
+flags to the sub-`make' (*note Communicating Options to a Sub-`make':
+Options/Recursion.), so your request to touch the files, or print the
+recipes, is propagated to the subsystem.

+
+5.7.2 Communicating Variables to a Sub-`make'
+---------------------------------------------
+
+Variable values of the top-level `make' can be passed to the sub-`make'
+through the environment by explicit request.  These variables are
+defined in the sub-`make' as defaults, but they do not override
+variables defined in the makefile used by the sub-`make' unless you use
+the `-e' switch (*note Summary of Options: Options Summary.).
+
+   To pass down, or "export", a variable, `make' adds the variable and
+its value to the environment for running each line of the recipe.  The
+sub-`make', in turn, uses the environment to initialize its table of
+variable values.  *Note Variables from the Environment: Environment.
+
+   Except by explicit request, `make' exports a variable only if it is
+either defined in the environment initially or set on the command line,
+and if its name consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores.
+Some shells cannot cope with environment variable names consisting of
+characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.
+
+   The value of the `make' variable `SHELL' is not exported.  Instead,
+the value of the `SHELL' variable from the invoking environment is
+passed to the sub-`make'.  You can force `make' to export its value for
+`SHELL' by using the `export' directive, described below.  *Note
+Choosing the Shell::.
+
+   The special variable `MAKEFLAGS' is always exported (unless you
+unexport it).  `MAKEFILES' is exported if you set it to anything.
+
+   `make' automatically passes down variable values that were defined
+on the command line, by putting them in the `MAKEFLAGS' variable.
+*Note Options/Recursion::.
+
+   Variables are _not_ normally passed down if they were created by
+default by `make' (*note Variables Used by Implicit Rules: Implicit
+Variables.).  The sub-`make' will define these for itself.
+
+   If you want to export specific variables to a sub-`make', use the
+`export' directive, like this:
+
+     export VARIABLE ...
+
+If you want to _prevent_ a variable from being exported, use the
+`unexport' directive, like this:
+
+     unexport VARIABLE ...
+
+In both of these forms, the arguments to `export' and `unexport' are
+expanded, and so could be variables or functions which expand to a
+(list of) variable names to be (un)exported.
+
+   As a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same
+time by doing:
+
+     export VARIABLE = value
+
+has the same result as:
+
+     VARIABLE = value
+     export VARIABLE
+
+and
+
+     export VARIABLE := value
+
+has the same result as:
+
+     VARIABLE := value
+     export VARIABLE
+
+   Likewise,
+
+     export VARIABLE += value
+
+is just like:
+
+     VARIABLE += value
+     export VARIABLE
+
+*Note Appending More Text to Variables: Appending.
+
+   You may notice that the `export' and `unexport' directives work in
+`make' in the same way they work in the shell, `sh'.
+
+   If you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use
+`export' by itself:
+
+     export
+
+This tells `make' that variables which are not explicitly mentioned in
+an `export' or `unexport' directive should be exported.  Any variable
+given in an `unexport' directive will still _not_ be exported.  If you
+use `export' by itself to export variables by default, variables whose
+names contain characters other than alphanumerics and underscores will
+not be exported unless specifically mentioned in an `export' directive.
+
+   The behavior elicited by an `export' directive by itself was the
+default in older versions of GNU `make'.  If your makefiles depend on
+this behavior and you want to be compatible with old versions of
+`make', you can write a rule for the special target
+`.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES' instead of using the `export' directive.  This
+will be ignored by old `make's, while the `export' directive will cause
+a syntax error.  
+
+   Likewise, you can use `unexport' by itself to tell `make' _not_ to
+export variables by default.  Since this is the default behavior, you
+would only need to do this if `export' had been used by itself earlier
+(in an included makefile, perhaps).  You *cannot* use `export' and
+`unexport' by themselves to have variables exported for some recipes
+and not for others.  The last `export' or `unexport' directive that
+appears by itself determines the behavior for the entire run of `make'.
+
+   As a special feature, the variable `MAKELEVEL' is changed when it is
+passed down from level to level.  This variable's value is a string
+which is the depth of the level as a decimal number.  The value is `0'
+for the top-level `make'; `1' for a sub-`make', `2' for a
+sub-sub-`make', and so on.  The incrementation happens when `make' sets
+up the environment for a recipe.
+
+   The main use of `MAKELEVEL' is to test it in a conditional directive
+(*note Conditional Parts of Makefiles: Conditionals.); this way you can
+write a makefile that behaves one way if run recursively and another
+way if run directly by you.
+
+   You can use the variable `MAKEFILES' to cause all sub-`make'
+commands to use additional makefiles.  The value of `MAKEFILES' is a
+whitespace-separated list of file names.  This variable, if defined in
+the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then
+it serves as a list of extra makefiles for the sub-`make' to read
+before the usual or specified ones.  *Note The Variable `MAKEFILES':
+MAKEFILES Variable.

+
+5.7.3 Communicating Options to a Sub-`make'
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Flags such as `-s' and `-k' are passed automatically to the sub-`make'
+through the variable `MAKEFLAGS'.  This variable is set up
+automatically by `make' to contain the flag letters that `make'
+received.  Thus, if you do `make -ks' then `MAKEFLAGS' gets the value
+`ks'.
+
+   As a consequence, every sub-`make' gets a value for `MAKEFLAGS' in
+its environment.  In response, it takes the flags from that value and
+processes them as if they had been given as arguments.  *Note Summary
+of Options: Options Summary.
+
+   Likewise variables defined on the command line are passed to the
+sub-`make' through `MAKEFLAGS'.  Words in the value of `MAKEFLAGS' that
+contain `=', `make' treats as variable definitions just as if they
+appeared on the command line.  *Note Overriding Variables: Overriding.
+
+   The options `-C', `-f', `-o', and `-W' are not put into `MAKEFLAGS';
+these options are not passed down.
+
+   The `-j' option is a special case (*note Parallel Execution:
+Parallel.).  If you set it to some numeric value `N' and your operating
+system supports it (most any UNIX system will; others typically won't),
+the parent `make' and all the sub-`make's will communicate to ensure
+that there are only `N' jobs running at the same time between them all.
+Note that any job that is marked recursive (*note Instead of Executing
+Recipes: Instead of Execution.)  doesn't count against the total jobs
+(otherwise we could get `N' sub-`make's running and have no slots left
+over for any real work!)
+
+   If your operating system doesn't support the above communication,
+then `-j 1' is always put into `MAKEFLAGS' instead of the value you
+specified.  This is because if the `-j' option were passed down to
+sub-`make's, you would get many more jobs running in parallel than you
+asked for.  If you give `-j' with no numeric argument, meaning to run
+as many jobs as possible in parallel, this is passed down, since
+multiple infinities are no more than one.
+
+   If you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the
+value of `MAKEFLAGS', like this:
+
+     subsystem:
+             cd subdir && $(MAKE) MAKEFLAGS=
+
+   The command line variable definitions really appear in the variable
+`MAKEOVERRIDES', and `MAKEFLAGS' contains a reference to this variable.
+If you do want to pass flags down normally, but don't want to pass down
+the command line variable definitions, you can reset `MAKEOVERRIDES' to
+empty, like this:
+
+     MAKEOVERRIDES =
+
+This is not usually useful to do.  However, some systems have a small
+fixed limit on the size of the environment, and putting so much
+information into the value of `MAKEFLAGS' can exceed it.  If you see
+the error message `Arg list too long', this may be the problem.  (For
+strict compliance with POSIX.2, changing `MAKEOVERRIDES' does not
+affect `MAKEFLAGS' if the special target `.POSIX' appears in the
+makefile.  You probably do not care about this.)
+
+   A similar variable `MFLAGS' exists also, for historical
+compatibility.  It has the same value as `MAKEFLAGS' except that it
+does not contain the command line variable definitions, and it always
+begins with a hyphen unless it is empty (`MAKEFLAGS' begins with a
+hyphen only when it begins with an option that has no single-letter
+version, such as `--warn-undefined-variables').  `MFLAGS' was
+traditionally used explicitly in the recursive `make' command, like
+this:
+
+     subsystem:
+             cd subdir && $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS)
+
+but now `MAKEFLAGS' makes this usage redundant.  If you want your
+makefiles to be compatible with old `make' programs, use this
+technique; it will work fine with more modern `make' versions too.
+
+   The `MAKEFLAGS' variable can also be useful if you want to have
+certain options, such as `-k' (*note Summary of Options: Options
+Summary.), set each time you run `make'.  You simply put a value for
+`MAKEFLAGS' in your environment.  You can also set `MAKEFLAGS' in a
+makefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for
+that makefile.  (Note that you cannot use `MFLAGS' this way.  That
+variable is set only for compatibility; `make' does not interpret a
+value you set for it in any way.)
+
+   When `make' interprets the value of `MAKEFLAGS' (either from the
+environment or from a makefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value
+does not already begin with one.  Then it chops the value into words
+separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were options
+given on the command line (except that `-C', `-f', `-h', `-o', `-W',
+and their long-named versions are ignored; and there is no error for an
+invalid option).
+
+   If you do put `MAKEFLAGS' in your environment, you should be sure not
+to include any options that will drastically affect the actions of
+`make' and undermine the purpose of makefiles and of `make' itself.
+For instance, the `-t', `-n', and `-q' options, if put in one of these
+variables, could have disastrous consequences and would certainly have
+at least surprising and probably annoying effects.

+
+5.7.4 The `--print-directory' Option
+------------------------------------
+
+If you use several levels of recursive `make' invocations, the `-w' or
+`--print-directory' option can make the output a lot easier to
+understand by showing each directory as `make' starts processing it and
+as `make' finishes processing it.  For example, if `make -w' is run in
+the directory `/u/gnu/make', `make' will print a line of the form:
+
+     make: Entering directory `/u/gnu/make'.
+
+before doing anything else, and a line of the form:
+
+     make: Leaving directory `/u/gnu/make'.
+
+when processing is completed.
+
+   Normally, you do not need to specify this option because `make' does
+it for you: `-w' is turned on automatically when you use the `-C'
+option, and in sub-`make's.  `make' will not automatically turn on `-w'
+if you also use `-s', which says to be silent, or if you use
+`--no-print-directory' to explicitly disable it.

+
+5.8 Defining Canned Recipes
+===========================
+
+When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets,
+you can define it as a canned sequence with the `define' directive, and
+refer to the canned sequence from the recipes for those targets.  The
+canned sequence is actually a variable, so the name must not conflict
+with other variable names.
+
+   Here is an example of defining a canned recipe:
+
+     define run-yacc =
+     yacc $(firstword $^)
+     mv y.tab.c $@
+     endef
+   
+Here `run-yacc' is the name of the variable being defined; `endef'
+marks the end of the definition; the lines in between are the commands.
+The `define' directive does not expand variable references and function
+calls in the canned sequence; the `$' characters, parentheses, variable
+names, and so on, all become part of the value of the variable you are
+defining.  *Note Defining Multi-Line Variables: Multi-Line, for a
+complete explanation of `define'.
+
+   The first command in this example runs Yacc on the first
+prerequisite of whichever rule uses the canned sequence.  The output
+file from Yacc is always named `y.tab.c'.  The second command moves the
+output to the rule's target file name.
+
+   To use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the recipe
+of a rule.  You can substitute it like any other variable (*note Basics
+of Variable References: Reference.).  Because variables defined by
+`define' are recursively expanded variables, all the variable
+references you wrote inside the `define' are expanded now.  For example:
+
+     foo.c : foo.y
+             $(run-yacc)
+
+`foo.y' will be substituted for the variable `$^' when it occurs in
+`run-yacc''s value, and `foo.c' for `$@'.
+
+   This is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in
+practice because `make' has an implicit rule to figure out these
+commands based on the file names involved (*note Using Implicit Rules:
+Implicit Rules.).
+
+   In recipe execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just
+as if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab.  In
+particular, `make' invokes a separate sub-shell for each line.  You can
+use the special prefix characters that affect command lines (`@', `-',
+and `+') on each line of a canned sequence.  *Note Writing Recipes in
+Rules: Recipes.  For example, using this canned sequence:
+
+     define frobnicate =
+     @echo "frobnicating target $@"
+     frob-step-1 $< -o $@-step-1
+     frob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@
+     endef
+
+`make' will not echo the first line, the `echo' command.  But it _will_
+echo the following two recipe lines.
+
+   On the other hand, prefix characters on the recipe line that refers
+to a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:
+
+     frob.out: frob.in
+             @$(frobnicate)
+
+does not echo _any_ recipe lines.  (*Note Recipe Echoing: Echoing, for
+a full explanation of `@'.)
+

+
+5.9 Using Empty Recipes
+=======================
+
+It is sometimes useful to define recipes which do nothing.  This is done
+simply by giving a recipe that consists of nothing but whitespace.  For
+example:
+
+     target: ;
+
+defines an empty recipe for `target'.  You could also use a line
+beginning with a recipe prefix character to define an empty recipe, but
+this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.
+
+   You may be wondering why you would want to define a recipe that does
+nothing.  The only reason this is useful is to prevent a target from
+getting implicit recipes (from implicit rules or the `.DEFAULT' special
+target; *note Implicit Rules:: and *note Defining Last-Resort Default
+Rules: Last Resort.).
+
+   You may be inclined to define empty recipes for targets that are not
+actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be remade.
+However, this is not the best way to do that, because the prerequisites
+may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist.
+*Note Phony Targets: Phony Targets, for a better way to do this.

+
+6 How to Use Variables
+**********************
+
+A "variable" is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string of
+text, called the variable's "value".  These values are substituted by
+explicit request into targets, prerequisites, recipes, and other parts
+of the makefile.  (In some other versions of `make', variables are
+called "macros".)  
+
+   Variables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when
+read, except for in recipes, the right-hand sides of variable
+definitions using `=', and the bodies of variable definitions using the
+`define' directive.
+
+   Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to
+compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files,
+directories to write output in, or anything else you can imagine.
+
+   A variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing
+`:', `#', `=', or whitespace.  However, variable names containing
+characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores should be
+considered carefully, as in some shells they cannot be passed through
+the environment to a sub-`make' (*note Communicating Variables to a
+Sub-`make': Variables/Recursion.).  Variable names beginning with `.'
+and an uppercase letter may be given special meaning in future versions
+of `make'.
+
+   Variable names are case-sensitive.  The names `foo', `FOO', and
+`Foo' all refer to different variables.
+
+   It is traditional to use upper case letters in variable names, but we
+recommend using lower case letters for variable names that serve
+internal purposes in the makefile, and reserving upper case for
+parameters that control implicit rules or for parameters that the user
+should override with command options (*note Overriding Variables:
+Overriding.).
+
+   A few variables have names that are a single punctuation character or
+just a few characters.  These are the "automatic variables", and they
+have particular specialized uses.  *Note Automatic Variables::.

+
+6.1 Basics of Variable References
+=================================
+
+To substitute a variable's value, write a dollar sign followed by the
+name of the variable in parentheses or braces: either `$(foo)' or
+`${foo}' is a valid reference to the variable `foo'.  This special
+significance of `$' is why you must write `$$' to have the effect of a
+single dollar sign in a file name or recipe.
+
+   Variable references can be used in any context: targets,
+prerequisites, recipes, most directives, and new variable values.  Here
+is an example of a common case, where a variable holds the names of all
+the object files in a program:
+
+     objects = program.o foo.o utils.o
+     program : $(objects)
+             cc -o program $(objects)
+
+     $(objects) : defs.h
+
+   Variable references work by strict textual substitution.  Thus, the
+rule
+
+     foo = c
+     prog.o : prog.$(foo)
+             $(foo)$(foo) -$(foo) prog.$(foo)
+
+could be used to compile a C program `prog.c'.  Since spaces before the
+variable value are ignored in variable assignments, the value of `foo'
+is precisely `c'.  (Don't actually write your makefiles this way!)
+
+   A dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign,
+open-parenthesis or open-brace treats that single character as the
+variable name.  Thus, you could reference the variable `x' with `$x'.
+However, this practice is strongly discouraged, except in the case of
+the automatic variables (*note Automatic Variables::).
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Flavors,  Next: Advanced,  Prev: Reference,  Up: Using Variables
+
+6.2 The Two Flavors of Variables
+================================
+
+There are two ways that a variable in GNU `make' can have a value; we
+call them the two "flavors" of variables.  The two flavors are
+distinguished in how they are defined and in what they do when expanded.
+
+   The first flavor of variable is a "recursively expanded" variable.
+Variables of this sort are defined by lines using `=' (*note Setting
+Variables: Setting.) or by the `define' directive (*note Defining
+Multi-Line Variables: Multi-Line.).  The value you specify is installed
+verbatim; if it contains references to other variables, these
+references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in the
+course of expanding some other string).  When this happens, it is
+called "recursive expansion".
+
+   For example,
+
+     foo = $(bar)
+     bar = $(ugh)
+     ugh = Huh?
+
+     all:;echo $(foo)
+
+will echo `Huh?': `$(foo)' expands to `$(bar)' which expands to
+`$(ugh)' which finally expands to `Huh?'.
+
+   This flavor of variable is the only sort supported by most other
+versions of `make'.  It has its advantages and its disadvantages.  An
+advantage (most would say) is that:
+
+     CFLAGS = $(include_dirs) -O
+     include_dirs = -Ifoo -Ibar
+
+will do what was intended: when `CFLAGS' is expanded in a recipe, it
+will expand to `-Ifoo -Ibar -O'.  A major disadvantage is that you
+cannot append something on the end of a variable, as in
+
+     CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -O
+
+because it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion.
+(Actually `make' detects the infinite loop and reports an error.)  
+
+   Another disadvantage is that any functions (*note Functions for
+Transforming Text: Functions.)  referenced in the definition will be
+executed every time the variable is expanded.  This makes `make' run
+slower; worse, it causes the `wildcard' and `shell' functions to give
+unpredictable results because you cannot easily control when they are
+called, or even how many times.
+
+   To avoid all the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded
+variables, there is another flavor: simply expanded variables.
+
+   "Simply expanded variables" are defined by lines using `:=' or `::='
+(*note Setting Variables: Setting.).  Both forms are equivalent in GNU
+`make'; however only the `::=' form is described by the POSIX standard
+(support for `::=' was added to the POSIX standard in 2012, so older
+versions of `make' won't accept this form either).
+
+   The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for all,
+expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the
+variable is defined.  The actual value of the simply expanded variable
+is the result of expanding the text that you write.  It does not
+contain any references to other variables; it contains their values _as
+of the time this variable was defined_.  Therefore,
+
+     x := foo
+     y := $(x) bar
+     x := later
+
+is equivalent to
+
+     y := foo bar
+     x := later
+
+   When a simply expanded variable is referenced, its value is
+substituted verbatim.
+
+   Here is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of
+`:=' in conjunction with the `shell' function.  (*Note The `shell'
+Function: Shell Function.)  This example also shows use of the variable
+`MAKELEVEL', which is changed when it is passed down from level to
+level.  (*Note Communicating Variables to a Sub-`make':
+Variables/Recursion, for information about `MAKELEVEL'.)
+
+     ifeq (0,${MAKELEVEL})
+     whoami    := $(shell whoami)
+     host-type := $(shell arch)
+     MAKE := ${MAKE} host-type=${host-type} whoami=${whoami}
+     endif
+
+An advantage of this use of `:=' is that a typical `descend into a
+directory' recipe then looks like this:
+
+     ${subdirs}:
+             ${MAKE} -C $@ all
+
+   Simply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile
+programming more predictable because they work like variables in most
+programming languages.  They allow you to redefine a variable using its
+own value (or its value processed in some way by one of the expansion
+functions) and to use the expansion functions much more efficiently
+(*note Functions for Transforming Text: Functions.).
+
+   You can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into
+variable values.  Leading whitespace characters are discarded from your
+input before substitution of variable references and function calls;
+this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value by
+protecting them with variable references, like this:
+
+     nullstring :=
+     space := $(nullstring) # end of the line
+
+Here the value of the variable `space' is precisely one space.  The
+comment `# end of the line' is included here just for clarity.  Since
+trailing space characters are _not_ stripped from variable values, just
+a space at the end of the line would have the same effect (but be
+rather hard to read).  If you put whitespace at the end of a variable
+value, it is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end of the
+line to make your intent clear.  Conversely, if you do _not_ want any
+whitespace characters at the end of your variable value, you must
+remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after some
+whitespace, such as this:
+
+     dir := /foo/bar    # directory to put the frobs in
+
+Here the value of the variable `dir' is `/foo/bar    ' (with four
+trailing spaces), which was probably not the intention.  (Imagine
+something like `$(dir)/file' with this definition!)
+
+   There is another assignment operator for variables, `?='.  This is
+called a conditional variable assignment operator, because it only has
+an effect if the variable is not yet defined.  This statement:
+
+     FOO ?= bar
+
+is exactly equivalent to this (*note The `origin' Function: Origin
+Function.):
+
+     ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
+       FOO = bar
+     endif
+
+   Note that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so `?='
+will not set that variable.

+6.3 Advanced Features for Reference to Variables
+================================================
+
+This section describes some advanced features you can use to reference
+variables in more flexible ways.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Substitution Refs::           Referencing a variable with
+                                  substitutions on the value.
+* Computed Names::              Computing the name of the variable to refer to.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Substitution Refs,  Next: Computed Names,  Prev: Advanced,  Up: Advanced
+
+6.3.1 Substitution References
+-----------------------------
+
+A "substitution reference" substitutes the value of a variable with
+alterations that you specify.  It has the form `$(VAR:A=B)' (or
+`${VAR:A=B}') and its meaning is to take the value of the variable VAR,
+replace every A at the end of a word with B in that value, and
+substitute the resulting string.
+
+   When we say "at the end of a word", we mean that A must appear
+either followed by whitespace or at the end of the value in order to be
+replaced; other occurrences of A in the value are unaltered.  For
+example:
+
+     foo := a.o b.o c.o
+     bar := $(foo:.o=.c)
+
+sets `bar' to `a.c b.c c.c'.  *Note Setting Variables: Setting.
+
+   A substitution reference is actually an abbreviation for use of the
+`patsubst' expansion function (*note Functions for String Substitution
+and Analysis: Text Functions.).  We provide substitution references as
+well as `patsubst' for compatibility with other implementations of
+`make'.
+
+   Another type of substitution reference lets you use the full power of
+the `patsubst' function.  It has the same form `$(VAR:A=B)' described
+above, except that now A must contain a single `%' character.  This
+case is equivalent to `$(patsubst A,B,$(VAR))'.  *Note Functions for
+String Substitution and Analysis: Text Functions, for a description of
+the `patsubst' function.
+
+For example:
+
+     foo := a.o b.o c.o
+     bar := $(foo:%.o=%.c)
+
+sets `bar' to `a.c b.c c.c'.

+
+6.3.2 Computed Variable Names
+-----------------------------
+
+Computed variable names are a complicated concept needed only for
+sophisticated makefile programming.  For most purposes you need not
+consider them, except to know that making a variable with a dollar sign
+in its name might have strange results.  However, if you are the type
+that wants to understand everything, or you are actually interested in
+what they do, read on.
+
+   Variables may be referenced inside the name of a variable.  This is
+called a "computed variable name" or a "nested variable reference".
+For example,
+
+     x = y
+     y = z
+     a := $($(x))
+
+defines `a' as `z': the `$(x)' inside `$($(x))' expands to `y', so
+`$($(x))' expands to `$(y)' which in turn expands to `z'.  Here the
+name of the variable to reference is not stated explicitly; it is
+computed by expansion of `$(x)'.  The reference `$(x)' here is nested
+within the outer variable reference.
+
+   The previous example shows two levels of nesting, but any number of
+levels is possible.  For example, here are three levels:
+
+     x = y
+     y = z
+     z = u
+     a := $($($(x)))
+
+Here the innermost `$(x)' expands to `y', so `$($(x))' expands to
+`$(y)' which in turn expands to `z'; now we have `$(z)', which becomes
+`u'.
+
+   References to recursively-expanded variables within a variable name
+are re-expanded in the usual fashion.  For example:
+
+     x = $(y)
+     y = z
+     z = Hello
+     a := $($(x))
+
+defines `a' as `Hello': `$($(x))' becomes `$($(y))' which becomes
+`$(z)' which becomes `Hello'.
+
+   Nested variable references can also contain modified references and
+function invocations (*note Functions for Transforming Text:
+Functions.), just like any other reference.  For example, using the
+`subst' function (*note Functions for String Substitution and Analysis:
+Text Functions.):
+
+     x = variable1
+     variable2 := Hello
+     y = $(subst 1,2,$(x))
+     z = y
+     a := $($($(z)))
+
+eventually defines `a' as `Hello'.  It is doubtful that anyone would
+ever want to write a nested reference as convoluted as this one, but it
+works: `$($($(z)))' expands to `$($(y))' which becomes `$($(subst
+1,2,$(x)))'.  This gets the value `variable1' from `x' and changes it
+by substitution to `variable2', so that the entire string becomes
+`$(variable2)', a simple variable reference whose value is `Hello'.
+
+   A computed variable name need not consist entirely of a single
+variable reference.  It can contain several variable references, as
+well as some invariant text.  For example,
+
+     a_dirs := dira dirb
+     1_dirs := dir1 dir2
+
+     a_files := filea fileb
+     1_files := file1 file2
+
+     ifeq "$(use_a)" "yes"
+     a1 := a
+     else
+     a1 := 1
+     endif
+
+     ifeq "$(use_dirs)" "yes"
+     df := dirs
+     else
+     df := files
+     endif
+
+     dirs := $($(a1)_$(df))
+
+will give `dirs' the same value as `a_dirs', `1_dirs', `a_files' or
+`1_files' depending on the settings of `use_a' and `use_dirs'.
+
+   Computed variable names can also be used in substitution references:
+
+     a_objects := a.o b.o c.o
+     1_objects := 1.o 2.o 3.o
+
+     sources := $($(a1)_objects:.o=.c)
+
+defines `sources' as either `a.c b.c c.c' or `1.c 2.c 3.c', depending
+on the value of `a1'.
+
+   The only restriction on this sort of use of nested variable
+references is that they cannot specify part of the name of a function
+to be called.  This is because the test for a recognized function name
+is done before the expansion of nested references.  For example,
+
+     ifdef do_sort
+     func := sort
+     else
+     func := strip
+     endif
+
+     bar := a d b g q c
+
+     foo := $($(func) $(bar))
+
+attempts to give `foo' the value of the variable `sort a d b g q c' or
+`strip a d b g q c', rather than giving `a d b g q c' as the argument
+to either the `sort' or the `strip' function.  This restriction could
+be removed in the future if that change is shown to be a good idea.
+
+   You can also use computed variable names in the left-hand side of a
+variable assignment, or in a `define' directive, as in:
+
+     dir = foo
+     $(dir)_sources := $(wildcard $(dir)/*.c)
+     define $(dir)_print =
+     lpr $($(dir)_sources)
+     endef
+
+This example defines the variables `dir', `foo_sources', and
+`foo_print'.
+
+   Note that "nested variable references" are quite different from
+"recursively expanded variables" (*note The Two Flavors of Variables:
+Flavors.), though both are used together in complex ways when doing
+makefile programming.

+6.4 How Variables Get Their Values
+==================================
+
+Variables can get values in several different ways:
+
+   * You can specify an overriding value when you run `make'.  *Note
+     Overriding Variables: Overriding.
+
+   * You can specify a value in the makefile, either with an assignment
+     (*note Setting Variables: Setting.) or with a verbatim definition
+     (*note Defining Multi-Line Variables: Multi-Line.).
+
+   * Variables in the environment become `make' variables.  *Note
+     Variables from the Environment: Environment.
+
+   * Several "automatic" variables are given new values for each rule.
+     Each of these has a single conventional use.  *Note Automatic
+     Variables::.
+
+   * Several variables have constant initial values.  *Note Variables
+     Used by Implicit Rules: Implicit Variables.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Setting,  Next: Appending,  Prev: Values,  Up: Using Variables
+
+6.5 Setting Variables
+=====================
+
+To set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the
+variable name followed by `=' `:=', or `::='.  Whatever follows the
+`=', `:=', or `::=' on the line becomes the value.  For example,
+
+     objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
+
+defines a variable named `objects'.  Whitespace around the variable
+name and immediately after the `=' is ignored.
+
+   Variables defined with `=' are "recursively expanded" variables.
+Variables defined with `:=' or `::=' are "simply expanded" variables;
+these definitions can contain variable references which will be
+expanded before the definition is made.  *Note The Two Flavors of
+Variables: Flavors.
+
+   The variable name may contain function and variable references, which
+are expanded when the line is read to find the actual variable name to
+use.
+
+   There is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the
+amount of memory on the computer.  You can split the value of a
+variable into multiple physical lines for readability (*note Splitting
+Long Lines: Splitting Lines.).
+
+   Most variable names are considered to have the empty string as a
+value if you have never set them.  Several variables have built-in
+initial values that are not empty, but you can set them in the usual
+ways (*note Variables Used by Implicit Rules: Implicit Variables.).
+Several special variables are set automatically to a new value for each
+rule; these are called the "automatic" variables (*note Automatic
+Variables::).
+
+   If you'd like a variable to be set to a value only if it's not
+already set, then you can use the shorthand operator `?=' instead of
+`='.  These two settings of the variable `FOO' are identical (*note The
+`origin' Function: Origin Function.):
+
+     FOO ?= bar
+
+and
+
+     ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
+     FOO = bar
+     endif
+
+   The shell assignment operator `!=' can be used to execute a program
+and set a variable to its output.  This operator first evaluates the
+right-hand side, then passes that result to the shell for execution.
+If the result of the execution ends in a newline, that one newline is
+removed; all other newlines are replaced by spaces.  The resulting
+string is then placed into the named recursively-expanded variable.
+For example:
+
+     hash != printf '\043'
+     file_list != find . -name '*.c'
+
+   If the result of the execution could produce a `$', and you don't
+intend what follows that to be interpreted as a make variable or
+function reference, then you must replace every `$' with `$$' as part
+of the execution.  Alternatively, you can set a simply expanded
+variable to the result of running a program using the `shell' function
+call.  *Note The `shell' Function: Shell Function.  For example:
+
+     hash := $(shell printf '\043')
+     var := $(shell find . -name "*.c")
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Appending,  Next: Override Directive,  Prev: Setting,  Up: Using Variables
+
+6.6 Appending More Text to Variables
+====================================
+
+Often it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already
+defined.  You do this with a line containing `+=', like this:
+
+     objects += another.o
+
+This takes the value of the variable `objects', and adds the text
+`another.o' to it (preceded by a single space).  Thus:
+
+     objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
+     objects += another.o
+
+sets `objects' to `main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o another.o'.
+
+   Using `+=' is similar to:
+
+     objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
+     objects := $(objects) another.o
+
+but differs in ways that become important when you use more complex
+values.
+
+   When the variable in question has not been defined before, `+=' acts
+just like normal `=': it defines a recursively-expanded variable.
+However, when there _is_ a previous definition, exactly what `+=' does
+depends on what flavor of variable you defined originally.  *Note The
+Two Flavors of Variables: Flavors, for an explanation of the two
+flavors of variables.
+
+   When you add to a variable's value with `+=', `make' acts
+essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial
+definition of the variable.  If you defined it first with `:=' or
+`::=', making it a simply-expanded variable, `+=' adds to that
+simply-expanded definition, and expands the new text before appending
+it to the old value just as `:=' does (see *note Setting Variables:
+Setting, for a full explanation of `:=' or `::=').  In fact,
+
+     variable := value
+     variable += more
+
+is exactly equivalent to:
+
+
+     variable := value
+     variable := $(variable) more
+
+   On the other hand, when you use `+=' with a variable that you defined
+first to be recursively-expanded using plain `=', `make' does something
+a bit different.  Recall that when you define a recursively-expanded
+variable, `make' does not expand the value you set for variable and
+function references immediately.  Instead it stores the text verbatim,
+and saves these variable and function references to be expanded later,
+when you refer to the new variable (*note The Two Flavors of Variables:
+Flavors.).  When you use `+=' on a recursively-expanded variable, it is
+this unexpanded text to which `make' appends the new text you specify.
+
+     variable = value
+     variable += more
+
+is roughly equivalent to:
+
+     temp = value
+     variable = $(temp) more
+
+except that of course it never defines a variable called `temp'.  The
+importance of this comes when the variable's old value contains
+variable references.  Take this common example:
+
+     CFLAGS = $(includes) -O
+     ...
+     CFLAGS += -pg # enable profiling
+
+The first line defines the `CFLAGS' variable with a reference to another
+variable, `includes'.  (`CFLAGS' is used by the rules for C
+compilation; *note Catalogue of Implicit Rules: Catalogue of Rules.)
+Using `=' for the definition makes `CFLAGS' a recursively-expanded
+variable, meaning `$(includes) -O' is _not_ expanded when `make'
+processes the definition of `CFLAGS'.  Thus, `includes' need not be
+defined yet for its value to take effect.  It only has to be defined
+before any reference to `CFLAGS'.  If we tried to append to the value
+of `CFLAGS' without using `+=', we might do it like this:
+
+     CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -pg # enable profiling
+
+This is pretty close, but not quite what we want.  Using `:=' redefines
+`CFLAGS' as a simply-expanded variable; this means `make' expands the
+text `$(CFLAGS) -pg' before setting the variable.  If `includes' is not
+yet defined, we get ` -O -pg', and a later definition of `includes'
+will have no effect.  Conversely, by using `+=' we set `CFLAGS' to the
+_unexpanded_ value `$(includes) -O -pg'.  Thus we preserve the
+reference to `includes', so if that variable gets defined at any later
+point, a reference like `$(CFLAGS)' still uses its value.

+
+6.7 The `override' Directive
+============================
+
+If a variable has been set with a command argument (*note Overriding
+Variables: Overriding.), then ordinary assignments in the makefile are
+ignored.  If you want to set the variable in the makefile even though
+it was set with a command argument, you can use an `override'
+directive, which is a line that looks like this:
+
+     override VARIABLE = VALUE
+
+or
+
+     override VARIABLE := VALUE
+
+   To append more text to a variable defined on the command line, use:
+
+     override VARIABLE += MORE TEXT
+
+*Note Appending More Text to Variables: Appending.
+
+   Variable assignments marked with the `override' flag have a higher
+priority than all other assignments, except another `override'.
+Subsequent assignments or appends to this variable which are not marked
+`override' will be ignored.
+
+   The `override' directive was not invented for escalation in the war
+between makefiles and command arguments.  It was invented so you can
+alter and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments.
+
+   For example, suppose you always want the `-g' switch when you run the
+C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other
+switches with a command argument just as usual.  You could use this
+`override' directive:
+
+     override CFLAGS += -g
+
+   You can also use `override' directives with `define' directives.
+This is done as you might expect:
+
+     override define foo =
+     bar
+     endef
+
+*Note Defining Multi-Line Variables: Multi-Line.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Multi-Line,  Next: Undefine Directive,  Prev: Override Directive,  Up: Using Variables
+
+6.8 Defining Multi-Line Variables
+=================================
+
+Another way to set the value of a variable is to use the `define'
+directive.  This directive has an unusual syntax which allows newline
+characters to be included in the value, which is convenient for
+defining both canned sequences of commands (*note Defining Canned
+Recipes: Canned Recipes.), and also sections of makefile syntax to use
+with `eval' (*note Eval Function::).
+
+   The `define' directive is followed on the same line by the name of
+the variable being defined and an (optional) assignment operator, and
+nothing more.  The value to give the variable appears on the following
+lines.  The end of the value is marked by a line containing just the
+word `endef'.  Aside from this difference in syntax, `define' works
+just like any other variable definition.  The variable name may contain
+function and variable references, which are expanded when the directive
+is read to find the actual variable name to use.
+
+   You may omit the variable assignment operator if you prefer.  If
+omitted, `make' assumes it to be `=' and creates a recursively-expanded
+variable (*note The Two Flavors of Variables: Flavors.).  When using a
+`+=' operator, the value is appended to the previous value as with any
+other append operation: with a single space separating the old and new
+values.
+
+   You may nest `define' directives: `make' will keep track of nested
+directives and report an error if they are not all properly closed with
+`endef'.  Note that lines beginning with the recipe prefix character
+are considered part of a recipe, so any `define' or `endef' strings
+appearing on such a line will not be considered `make' directives.
+
+     define two-lines =
+     echo foo
+     echo $(bar)
+     endef
+
+   The value in an ordinary assignment cannot contain a newline; but the
+newlines that separate the lines of the value in a `define' become part
+of the variable's value (except for the final newline which precedes
+the `endef' and is not considered part of the value).
+
+   When used in a recipe, the previous example is functionally
+equivalent to this:
+
+     two-lines = echo foo; echo $(bar)
+
+since two commands separated by semicolon behave much like two separate
+shell commands.  However, note that using two separate lines means
+`make' will invoke the shell twice, running an independent sub-shell
+for each line.  *Note Recipe Execution: Execution.
+
+   If you want variable definitions made with `define' to take
+precedence over command-line variable definitions, you can use the
+`override' directive together with `define':
+
+     override define two-lines =
+     foo
+     $(bar)
+     endef
+
+*Note The `override' Directive: Override Directive.

+
+6.9 Undefining Variables
+========================
+
+If you want to clear a variable, setting its value to empty is usually
+sufficient. Expanding such a variable will yield the same result (empty
+string) regardless of whether it was set or not. However, if you are
+using the `flavor' (*note Flavor Function::) and `origin' (*note Origin
+Function::) functions, there is a difference between a variable that
+was never set and a variable with an empty value.  In such situations
+you may want to use the `undefine' directive to make a variable appear
+as if it was never set. For example:
+
+     foo := foo
+     bar = bar
+
+     undefine foo
+     undefine bar
+
+     $(info $(origin foo))
+     $(info $(flavor bar))
+
+   This example will print "undefined" for both variables.
+
+   If you want to undefine a command-line variable definition, you can
+use the `override' directive together with `undefine', similar to how
+this is done for variable definitions:
+
+     override undefine CFLAGS
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Environment,  Next: Target-specific,  Prev: Undefine Directive,  Up: Using Variables
+
+6.10 Variables from the Environment
+===================================
+
+Variables in `make' can come from the environment in which `make' is
+run.  Every environment variable that `make' sees when it starts up is
+transformed into a `make' variable with the same name and value.
+However, an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command
+argument, overrides the environment.  (If the `-e' flag is specified,
+then values from the environment override assignments in the makefile.
+*Note Summary of Options: Options Summary.  But this is not recommended
+practice.)
+
+   Thus, by setting the variable `CFLAGS' in your environment, you can
+cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches
+you prefer.  This is safe for variables with standard or conventional
+meanings because you know that no makefile will use them for other
+things.  (Note this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set
+`CFLAGS' explicitly and therefore are not affected by the value in the
+environment.)
+
+   When `make' runs a recipe, variables defined in the makefile are
+placed into the environment of each shell.  This allows you to pass
+values to sub-`make' invocations (*note Recursive Use of `make':
+Recursion.).  By default, only variables that came from the environment
+or the command line are passed to recursive invocations.  You can use
+the `export' directive to pass other variables.  *Note Communicating
+Variables to a Sub-`make': Variables/Recursion, for full details.
+
+   Other use of variables from the environment is not recommended.  It
+is not wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on
+environment variables set up outside their control, since this would
+cause different users to get different results from the same makefile.
+This is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.
+
+   Such problems would be especially likely with the variable `SHELL',
+which is normally present in the environment to specify the user's
+choice of interactive shell.  It would be very undesirable for this
+choice to affect `make'; so, `make' handles the `SHELL' environment
+variable in a special way; see *note Choosing the Shell::.

+
+6.11 Target-specific Variable Values
+====================================
+
+Variable values in `make' are usually global; that is, they are the
+same regardless of where they are evaluated (unless they're reset, of
+course).  One exception to that is automatic variables (*note Automatic
+Variables::).
+
+   The other exception is "target-specific variable values".  This
+feature allows you to define different values for the same variable,
+based on the target that `make' is currently building.  As with
+automatic variables, these values are only available within the context
+of a target's recipe (and in other target-specific assignments).
+
+   Set a target-specific variable value like this:
+
+     TARGET ... : VARIABLE-ASSIGNMENT
+
+   Target-specific variable assignments can be prefixed with any or all
+of the special keywords `export', `override', or `private'; these apply
+their normal behavior to this instance of the variable only.
+
+   Multiple TARGET values create a target-specific variable value for
+each member of the target list individually.
+
+   The VARIABLE-ASSIGNMENT can be any valid form of assignment;
+recursive (`='), simple (`:=' or `::='), appending (`+='), or
+conditional (`?=').  All variables that appear within the
+VARIABLE-ASSIGNMENT are evaluated within the context of the target:
+thus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values will be in
+effect.  Note that this variable is actually distinct from any "global"
+value: the two variables do not have to have the same flavor (recursive
+vs. simple).
+
+   Target-specific variables have the same priority as any other
+makefile variable.  Variables provided on the command line (and in the
+environment if the `-e' option is in force) will take precedence.
+Specifying the `override' directive will allow the target-specific
+variable value to be preferred.
+
+   There is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when
+you define a target-specific variable that variable value is also in
+effect for all prerequisites of this target, and all their
+prerequisites, etc. (unless those prerequisites override that variable
+with their own target-specific variable value).  So, for example, a
+statement like this:
+
+     prog : CFLAGS = -g
+     prog : prog.o foo.o bar.o
+
+will set `CFLAGS' to `-g' in the recipe for `prog', but it will also
+set `CFLAGS' to `-g' in the recipes that create `prog.o', `foo.o', and
+`bar.o', and any recipes which create their prerequisites.
+
+   Be aware that a given prerequisite will only be built once per
+invocation of make, at most.  If the same file is a prerequisite of
+multiple targets, and each of those targets has a different value for
+the same target-specific variable, then the first target to be built
+will cause that prerequisite to be built and the prerequisite will
+inherit the target-specific value from the first target.  It will
+ignore the target-specific values from any other targets.

+
+6.12 Pattern-specific Variable Values
+=====================================
+
+In addition to target-specific variable values (*note Target-specific
+Variable Values: Target-specific.), GNU `make' supports
+pattern-specific variable values.  In this form, the variable is
+defined for any target that matches the pattern specified.
+
+   Set a pattern-specific variable value like this:
+
+     PATTERN ... : VARIABLE-ASSIGNMENT
+   where PATTERN is a %-pattern.  As with target-specific variable
+values, multiple PATTERN values create a pattern-specific variable
+value for each pattern individually.  The VARIABLE-ASSIGNMENT can be
+any valid form of assignment.  Any command line variable setting will
+take precedence, unless `override' is specified.
+
+   For example:
+
+     %.o : CFLAGS = -O
+
+will assign `CFLAGS' the value of `-O' for all targets matching the
+pattern `%.o'.
+
+   If a target matches more than one pattern, the matching
+pattern-specific variables with longer stems are interpreted first.
+This results in more specific variables taking precedence over the more
+generic ones, for example:
+
+     %.o: %.c
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@
+
+     lib/%.o: CFLAGS := -fPIC -g
+     %.o: CFLAGS := -g
+
+     all: foo.o lib/bar.o
+
+   In this example the first definition of the `CFLAGS' variable will
+be used to update `lib/bar.o' even though the second one also applies
+to this target. Pattern-specific variables which result in the same
+stem length are considered in the order in which they were defined in
+the makefile.
+
+   Pattern-specific variables are searched after any target-specific
+variables defined explicitly for that target, and before target-specific
+variables defined for the parent target.

+
+6.13 Suppressing Inheritance
+============================
+
+As described in previous sections, `make' variables are inherited by
+prerequisites.  This capability allows you to modify the behavior of a
+prerequisite based on which targets caused it to be rebuilt.  For
+example, you might set a target-specific variable on a `debug' target,
+then running `make debug' will cause that variable to be inherited by
+all prerequisites of `debug', while just running `make all' (for
+example) would not have that assignment.
+
+   Sometimes, however, you may not want a variable to be inherited.  For
+these situations, `make' provides the `private' modifier.  Although
+this modifier can be used with any variable assignment, it makes the
+most sense with target- and pattern-specific variables.  Any variable
+marked `private' will be visible to its local target but will not be
+inherited by prerequisites of that target.  A global variable marked
+`private' will be visible in the global scope but will not be inherited
+by any target, and hence will not be visible in any recipe.
+
+   As an example, consider this makefile:
+     EXTRA_CFLAGS =
+
+     prog: private EXTRA_CFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
+     prog: a.o b.o
+
+   Due to the `private' modifier, `a.o' and `b.o' will not inherit the
+`EXTRA_CFLAGS' variable assignment from the `prog' target.
+

+File: make.info,  Node: Special Variables,  Prev: Suppressing Inheritance,  Up: Using Variables
+
+6.14 Other Special Variables
+============================
+
+GNU `make' supports some variables that have special properties.
+
+`MAKEFILE_LIST'
+     Contains the name of each makefile that is parsed by `make', in
+     the order in which it was parsed.  The name is appended just
+     before `make' begins to parse the makefile.  Thus, if the first
+     thing a makefile does is examine the last word in this variable, it
+     will be the name of the current makefile.  Once the current
+     makefile has used `include', however, the last word will be the
+     just-included makefile.
+
+     If a makefile named `Makefile' has this content:
+
+          name1 := $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))
+
+          include inc.mk
+
+          name2 := $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))
+
+          all:
+                  @echo name1 = $(name1)
+                  @echo name2 = $(name2)
+
+     then you would expect to see this output:
+
+          name1 = Makefile
+          name2 = inc.mk
+
+`.DEFAULT_GOAL'
+     Sets the default goal to be used if no targets were specified on
+     the command line (*note Arguments to Specify the Goals: Goals.).
+     The `.DEFAULT_GOAL' variable allows you to discover the current
+     default goal, restart the default goal selection algorithm by
+     clearing its value, or to explicitly set the default goal.  The
+     following example illustrates these cases:
+
+          # Query the default goal.
+          ifeq ($(.DEFAULT_GOAL),)
+            $(warning no default goal is set)
+          endif
+
+          .PHONY: foo
+          foo: ; @echo $@
+
+          $(warning default goal is $(.DEFAULT_GOAL))
+
+          # Reset the default goal.
+          .DEFAULT_GOAL :=
+
+          .PHONY: bar
+          bar: ; @echo $@
+
+          $(warning default goal is $(.DEFAULT_GOAL))
+
+          # Set our own.
+          .DEFAULT_GOAL := foo
+
+     This makefile prints:
+
+          no default goal is set
+          default goal is foo
+          default goal is bar
+          foo
+
+     Note that assigning more than one target name to `.DEFAULT_GOAL' is
+     invalid and will result in an error.
+
+`MAKE_RESTARTS'
+     This variable is set only if this instance of `make' has restarted
+     (*note How Makefiles Are Remade: Remaking Makefiles.): it will
+     contain the number of times this instance has restarted.  Note
+     this is not the same as recursion (counted by the `MAKELEVEL'
+     variable).  You should not set, modify, or export this variable.
+
+`.RECIPEPREFIX'
+     The first character of the value of this variable is used as the
+     character make assumes is introducing a recipe line.  If the
+     variable is empty (as it is by default) that character is the
+     standard tab character.  For example, this is a valid makefile:
+
+          .RECIPEPREFIX = >
+          all:
+          > @echo Hello, world
+
+     The value of `.RECIPEPREFIX' can be changed multiple times; once
+     set it stays in effect for all rules parsed until it is modified.
+
+`.VARIABLES'
+     Expands to a list of the _names_ of all global variables defined
+     so far.  This includes variables which have empty values, as well
+     as built-in variables (*note Variables Used by Implicit Rules:
+     Implicit Variables.), but does not include any variables which are
+     only defined in a target-specific context.  Note that any value
+     you assign to this variable will be ignored; it will always return
+     its special value.
+
+`.FEATURES'
+     Expands to a list of special features supported by this version of
+     `make'.  Possible values include, but are not limited to:
+
+    `archives'
+          Supports `ar' (archive) files using special file name syntax.
+          *Note Using `make' to Update Archive Files: Archives.

+          Supports the `-L' (`--check-symlink-times') flag.  *Note

+
+    `else-if'
+          Supports "else if" non-nested conditionals.  *Note Syntax of

+
+    `jobserver'
+          Supports "job server" enhanced parallel builds.  *Note

+
+    `oneshell'
+          Supports the `.ONESHELL' special target.  *Note Using One
+          Shell: One Shell.

+          Prerequisites: Prerequisite Types.
+
+    `second-expansion'
+          Supports secondary expansion of prerequisite lists.
+
+    `shortest-stem'
+          Uses the "shortest stem" method of choosing which pattern, of
+          multiple applicable options, will be used.  *Note How
+          Patterns Match: Pattern Match.
+
+    `target-specific'
+          Supports target-specific and pattern-specific variable
+          assignments.  *Note Target-specific Variable Values:
+          Target-specific.

+    `undefine'
+          Supports the `undefine' directive.  *Note Undefine

+    `guile'
+          Has GNU Guile available as an embedded extension language.
+          *Note Guile Function::.

+
+`.INCLUDE_DIRS'
+     Expands to a list of directories that `make' searches for included

+7 Conditional Parts of Makefiles
+********************************
+
+A "conditional" directive causes part of a makefile to be obeyed or
+ignored depending on the values of variables.  Conditionals can compare
+the value of one variable to another, or the value of a variable to a
+constant string.  Conditionals control what `make' actually "sees" in
+the makefile, so they _cannot_ be used to control recipes at the time
+of execution.

+File: make.info,  Node: Conditional Example,  Next: Conditional Syntax,  Prev: Conditionals,  Up: Conditionals
+
+7.1 Example of a Conditional
+============================
+
+The following example of a conditional tells `make' to use one set of
+libraries if the `CC' variable is `gcc', and a different set of
+libraries otherwise.  It works by controlling which of two recipe lines
+will be used for the rule.  The result is that `CC=gcc' as an argument
+to `make' changes not only which compiler is used but also which
+libraries are linked.
+
+     libs_for_gcc = -lgnu
+     normal_libs =
+
+     foo: $(objects)
+     ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
+             $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
+     else
+             $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
+     endif
+
+   This conditional uses three directives: one `ifeq', one `else' and
+one `endif'.
+
+   The `ifeq' directive begins the conditional, and specifies the
+condition.  It contains two arguments, separated by a comma and
+surrounded by parentheses.  Variable substitution is performed on both
+arguments and then they are compared.  The lines of the makefile
+following the `ifeq' are obeyed if the two arguments match; otherwise
+they are ignored.
+
+   The `else' directive causes the following lines to be obeyed if the
+previous conditional failed.  In the example above, this means that the
+second alternative linking command is used whenever the first
+alternative is not used.  It is optional to have an `else' in a
+conditional.
+
+   The `endif' directive ends the conditional.  Every conditional must
+end with an `endif'.  Unconditional makefile text follows.
+
+   As this example illustrates, conditionals work at the textual level:
+the lines of the conditional are treated as part of the makefile, or
+ignored, according to the condition.  This is why the larger syntactic
+units of the makefile, such as rules, may cross the beginning or the
+end of the conditional.
+
+   When the variable `CC' has the value `gcc', the above example has
+this effect:
+
+     foo: $(objects)
+             $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
+
+When the variable `CC' has any other value, the effect is this:
+
+     foo: $(objects)
+             $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
+
+   Equivalent results can be obtained in another way by
+conditionalizing a variable assignment and then using the variable
+unconditionally:
+
+     libs_for_gcc = -lgnu
+     normal_libs =
+
+     ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
+       libs=$(libs_for_gcc)
+     else
+       libs=$(normal_libs)
+     endif
+
+     foo: $(objects)
+             $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs)

+
+7.2 Syntax of Conditionals
+==========================
+
+The syntax of a simple conditional with no `else' is as follows:
+
+     CONDITIONAL-DIRECTIVE
+     TEXT-IF-TRUE
+     endif
+
+The TEXT-IF-TRUE may be any lines of text, to be considered as part of
+the makefile if the condition is true.  If the condition is false, no
+text is used instead.
+
+   The syntax of a complex conditional is as follows:
+
+     CONDITIONAL-DIRECTIVE
+     TEXT-IF-TRUE
+     else
+     TEXT-IF-FALSE
+     endif
+
+   or:
+
+     CONDITIONAL-DIRECTIVE
+     TEXT-IF-ONE-IS-TRUE
+     else CONDITIONAL-DIRECTIVE
+     TEXT-IF-TRUE
+     else
+     TEXT-IF-FALSE
+     endif
+
+There can be as many "`else' CONDITIONAL-DIRECTIVE" clauses as
+necessary.  Once a given condition is true, TEXT-IF-TRUE is used and no
+other clause is used; if no condition is true then TEXT-IF-FALSE is
+used.  The TEXT-IF-TRUE and TEXT-IF-FALSE can be any number of lines of
+text.
+
+   The syntax of the CONDITIONAL-DIRECTIVE is the same whether the
+conditional is simple or complex; after an `else' or not.  There are
+four different directives that test different conditions.  Here is a
+table of them:
+
+`ifeq (ARG1, ARG2)'
+`ifeq 'ARG1' 'ARG2''
+`ifeq "ARG1" "ARG2"'
+`ifeq "ARG1" 'ARG2''
+`ifeq 'ARG1' "ARG2"'
+     Expand all variable references in ARG1 and ARG2 and compare them.
+     If they are identical, the TEXT-IF-TRUE is effective; otherwise,
+     the TEXT-IF-FALSE, if any, is effective.
+
+     Often you want to test if a variable has a non-empty value.  When
+     the value results from complex expansions of variables and
+     functions, expansions you would consider empty may actually
+     contain whitespace characters and thus are not seen as empty.
+     However, you can use the `strip' function (*note Text Functions::)
+     to avoid interpreting whitespace as a non-empty value.  For
+     example:
+
+          ifeq ($(strip $(foo)),)
+          TEXT-IF-EMPTY
+          endif
+
+     will evaluate TEXT-IF-EMPTY even if the expansion of `$(foo)'
+     contains whitespace characters.
+
+`ifneq (ARG1, ARG2)'
+`ifneq 'ARG1' 'ARG2''
+`ifneq "ARG1" "ARG2"'
+`ifneq "ARG1" 'ARG2''
+`ifneq 'ARG1' "ARG2"'
+     Expand all variable references in ARG1 and ARG2 and compare them.
+     If they are different, the TEXT-IF-TRUE is effective; otherwise,
+     the TEXT-IF-FALSE, if any, is effective.
+
+`ifdef VARIABLE-NAME'
+     The `ifdef' form takes the _name_ of a variable as its argument,
+     not a reference to a variable.  The value of that variable has a
+     non-empty value, the TEXT-IF-TRUE is effective; otherwise, the
+     TEXT-IF-FALSE, if any, is effective.  Variables that have never
+     been defined have an empty value.  The text VARIABLE-NAME is
+     expanded, so it could be a variable or function that expands to
+     the name of a variable.  For example:
+
+          bar = true
+          foo = bar
+          ifdef $(foo)
+          frobozz = yes
+          endif
+
+     The variable reference `$(foo)' is expanded, yielding `bar', which
+     is considered to be the name of a variable.  The variable `bar' is
+     not expanded, but its value is examined to determine if it is
+     non-empty.
+
+     Note that `ifdef' only tests whether a variable has a value.  It
+     does not expand the variable to see if that value is nonempty.
+     Consequently, tests using `ifdef' return true for all definitions
+     except those like `foo ='.  To test for an empty value, use
+     `ifeq ($(foo),)'.  For example,
+
+          bar =
+          foo = $(bar)
+          ifdef foo
+          frobozz = yes
+          else
+          frobozz = no
+          endif
+
+     sets `frobozz' to `yes', while:
+
+          foo =
+          ifdef foo
+          frobozz = yes
+          else
+          frobozz = no
+          endif
+
+     sets `frobozz' to `no'.
+
+`ifndef VARIABLE-NAME'
+     If the variable VARIABLE-NAME has an empty value, the TEXT-IF-TRUE
+     is effective; otherwise, the TEXT-IF-FALSE, if any, is effective.
+     The rules for expansion and testing of VARIABLE-NAME are identical
+     to the `ifdef' directive.
+
+   Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the
+conditional directive line, but a tab is not allowed.  (If the line
+begins with a tab, it will be considered part of a recipe for a rule.)
+Aside from this, extra spaces or tabs may be inserted with no effect
+anywhere except within the directive name or within an argument.  A
+comment starting with `#' may appear at the end of the line.
+
+   The other two directives that play a part in a conditional are `else'
+and `endif'.  Each of these directives is written as one word, with no
+arguments.  Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the
+line, and spaces or tabs at the end.  A comment starting with `#' may
+appear at the end of the line.
+
+   Conditionals affect which lines of the makefile `make' uses.  If the
+condition is true, `make' reads the lines of the TEXT-IF-TRUE as part
+of the makefile; if the condition is false, `make' ignores those lines
+completely.  It follows that syntactic units of the makefile, such as
+rules, may safely be split across the beginning or the end of the
+conditional.
+
+   `make' evaluates conditionals when it reads a makefile.
+Consequently, you cannot use automatic variables in the tests of
+conditionals because they are not defined until recipes are run (*note
+Automatic Variables::).
+
+   To prevent intolerable confusion, it is not permitted to start a
+conditional in one makefile and end it in another.  However, you may
+write an `include' directive within a conditional, provided you do not
+attempt to terminate the conditional inside the included file.

+
+7.3 Conditionals that Test Flags
+================================
+
+You can write a conditional that tests `make' command flags such as
+`-t' by using the variable `MAKEFLAGS' together with the `findstring'
+function (*note Functions for String Substitution and Analysis: Text
+Functions.).  This is useful when `touch' is not enough to make a file
+appear up to date.
+
+   The `findstring' function determines whether one string appears as a
+substring of another.  If you want to test for the `-t' flag, use `t'
+as the first string and the value of `MAKEFLAGS' as the other.
+
+   For example, here is how to arrange to use `ranlib -t' to finish
+marking an archive file up to date:
+
+     archive.a: ...
+     ifneq (,$(findstring t,$(MAKEFLAGS)))
+             +touch archive.a
+             +ranlib -t archive.a
+     else
+             ranlib archive.a
+     endif
+
+The `+' prefix marks those recipe lines as "recursive" so that they
+will be executed despite use of the `-t' flag.  *Note Recursive Use of
+`make': Recursion.

+8 Functions for Transforming Text
+*********************************
+
+"Functions" allow you to do text processing in the makefile to compute
+the files to operate on or the commands to use in recipes.  You use a
+function in a "function call", where you give the name of the function
+and some text (the "arguments") for the function to operate on.  The
+result of the function's processing is substituted into the makefile at
+the point of the call, just as a variable might be substituted.

+8.1 Function Call Syntax
+========================
+
+A function call resembles a variable reference.  It can appear anywhere
+a variable reference can appear, and it is expanded using the same
+rules as variable references.  A function call looks like this:
+
+     $(FUNCTION ARGUMENTS)
+
+or like this:
+
+     ${FUNCTION ARGUMENTS}
+
+   Here FUNCTION is a function name; one of a short list of names that
+are part of `make'.  You can also essentially create your own functions
+by using the `call' built-in function.
+
+   The ARGUMENTS are the arguments of the function.  They are separated
+from the function name by one or more spaces or tabs, and if there is
+more than one argument, then they are separated by commas.  Such
+whitespace and commas are not part of an argument's value.  The
+delimiters which you use to surround the function call, whether
+parentheses or braces, can appear in an argument only in matching pairs;
+the other kind of delimiters may appear singly.  If the arguments
+themselves contain other function calls or variable references, it is
+wisest to use the same kind of delimiters for all the references; write
+`$(subst a,b,$(x))', not `$(subst a,b,${x})'.  This is because it is
+clearer, and because only one type of delimiter is matched to find the
+end of the reference.
+
+   The text written for each argument is processed by substitution of
+variables and function calls to produce the argument value, which is
+the text on which the function acts.  The substitution is done in the
+order in which the arguments appear.
+
+   Commas and unmatched parentheses or braces cannot appear in the text
+of an argument as written; leading spaces cannot appear in the text of
+the first argument as written.  These characters can be put into the
+argument value by variable substitution.  First define variables
+`comma' and `space' whose values are isolated comma and space
+characters, then substitute these variables where such characters are
+wanted, like this:
+
+     comma:= ,
+     empty:=
+     space:= $(empty) $(empty)
+     foo:= a b c
+     bar:= $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))
+     # bar is now `a,b,c'.
+
+Here the `subst' function replaces each space with a comma, through the
+value of `foo', and substitutes the result.

+8.2 Functions for String Substitution and Analysis
+==================================================
+
+Here are some functions that operate on strings:
+
+`$(subst FROM,TO,TEXT)'
+     Performs a textual replacement on the text TEXT: each occurrence
+     of FROM is replaced by TO.  The result is substituted for the
+     function call.  For example,
+
+          $(subst ee,EE,feet on the street)
+
+     substitutes the string `fEEt on the strEEt'.
+
+`$(patsubst PATTERN,REPLACEMENT,TEXT)'
+     Finds whitespace-separated words in TEXT that match PATTERN and
+     replaces them with REPLACEMENT.  Here PATTERN may contain a `%'
+     which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters
+     within a word.  If REPLACEMENT also contains a `%', the `%' is
+     replaced by the text that matched the `%' in PATTERN.  Only the
+     first `%' in the PATTERN and REPLACEMENT is treated this way; any
+     subsequent `%' is unchanged.
+
+     `%' characters in `patsubst' function invocations can be quoted
+     with preceding backslashes (`\').  Backslashes that would
+     otherwise quote `%' characters can be quoted with more backslashes.
+     Backslashes that quote `%' characters or other backslashes are
+     removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a
+     stem substituted into it.  Backslashes that are not in danger of
+     quoting `%' characters go unmolested.  For example, the pattern
+     `the\%weird\\%pattern\\' has `the%weird\' preceding the operative
+     `%' character, and `pattern\\' following it.  The final two
+     backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any `%'
+     character.
+
+     Whitespace between words is folded into single space characters;
+     leading and trailing whitespace is discarded.
+
+     For example,
+
+          $(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)
+
+     produces the value `x.c.o bar.o'.
+
+     Substitution references (*note Substitution References:
+     Substitution Refs.) are a simpler way to get the effect of the
+     `patsubst' function:
+
+          $(VAR:PATTERN=REPLACEMENT)
+
+     is equivalent to
+
+          $(patsubst PATTERN,REPLACEMENT,$(VAR))
+
+     The second shorthand simplifies one of the most common uses of
+     `patsubst': replacing the suffix at the end of file names.
+
+          $(VAR:SUFFIX=REPLACEMENT)
+
+     is equivalent to
+
+          $(patsubst %SUFFIX,%REPLACEMENT,$(VAR))
+
+     For example, you might have a list of object files:
+
+          objects = foo.o bar.o baz.o
+
+     To get the list of corresponding source files, you could simply
+     write:
+
+          $(objects:.o=.c)
+
+     instead of using the general form:
+
+          $(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(objects))
+
+`$(strip STRING)'
+     Removes leading and trailing whitespace from STRING and replaces
+     each internal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a
+     single space.  Thus, `$(strip a b  c )' results in `a b c'.
+
+     The function `strip' can be very useful when used in conjunction
+     with conditionals.  When comparing something with the empty string
+     `' using `ifeq' or `ifneq', you usually want a string of just
+     whitespace to match the empty string (*note Conditionals::).
+
+     Thus, the following may fail to have the desired results:
+
+          .PHONY: all
+          ifneq   "$(needs_made)" ""
+          all: $(needs_made)
+          else
+          all:;@echo 'Nothing to make!'
+          endif
+
+     Replacing the variable reference `$(needs_made)' with the function
+     call `$(strip $(needs_made))' in the `ifneq' directive would make
+     it more robust.
+
+`$(findstring FIND,IN)'
+     Searches IN for an occurrence of FIND.  If it occurs, the value is
+     FIND; otherwise, the value is empty.  You can use this function in
+     a conditional to test for the presence of a specific substring in
+     a given string.  Thus, the two examples,
+
+          $(findstring a,a b c)
+          $(findstring a,b c)
+
+     produce the values `a' and `' (the empty string), respectively.
+     *Note Testing Flags::, for a practical application of `findstring'.
+
+`$(filter PATTERN...,TEXT)'
+     Returns all whitespace-separated words in TEXT that _do_ match any
+     of the PATTERN words, removing any words that _do not_ match.  The
+     patterns are written using `%', just like the patterns used in the
+     `patsubst' function above.
+
+     The `filter' function can be used to separate out different types
+     of strings (such as file names) in a variable.  For example:
+
+          sources := foo.c bar.c baz.s ugh.h
+          foo: $(sources)
+                  cc $(filter %.c %.s,$(sources)) -o foo
+
+     says that `foo' depends of `foo.c', `bar.c', `baz.s' and `ugh.h'
+     but only `foo.c', `bar.c' and `baz.s' should be specified in the
+     command to the compiler.
+
+`$(filter-out PATTERN...,TEXT)'
+     Returns all whitespace-separated words in TEXT that _do not_ match
+     any of the PATTERN words, removing the words that _do_ match one
+     or more.  This is the exact opposite of the `filter' function.
+
+     For example, given:
+
+          objects=main1.o foo.o main2.o bar.o
+          mains=main1.o main2.o
+
+     the following generates a list which contains all the object files
+     not in `mains':
+
+          $(filter-out $(mains),$(objects))
+
+`$(sort LIST)'
+     Sorts the words of LIST in lexical order, removing duplicate
+     words.  The output is a list of words separated by single spaces.
+     Thus,
+
+          $(sort foo bar lose)
+
+     returns the value `bar foo lose'.
+
+     Incidentally, since `sort' removes duplicate words, you can use it
+     for this purpose even if you don't care about the sort order.
+
+`$(word N,TEXT)'
+     Returns the Nth word of TEXT.  The legitimate values of N start
+     from 1.  If N is bigger than the number of words in TEXT, the
+     value is empty.  For example,
+
+          $(word 2, foo bar baz)
+
+     returns `bar'.
+
+`$(wordlist S,E,TEXT)'
+     Returns the list of words in TEXT starting with word S and ending
+     with word E (inclusive).  The legitimate values of S start from 1;
+     E may start from 0.  If S is bigger than the number of words in
+     TEXT, the value is empty.  If E is bigger than the number of words
+     in TEXT, words up to the end of TEXT are returned.  If S is
+     greater than E, nothing is returned.  For example,
+
+          $(wordlist 2, 3, foo bar baz)
+
+     returns `bar baz'.
+
+`$(words TEXT)'
+     Returns the number of words in TEXT.  Thus, the last word of TEXT
+     is `$(word $(words TEXT),TEXT)'.
+
+`$(firstword NAMES...)'
+     The argument NAMES is regarded as a series of names, separated by
+     whitespace.  The value is the first name in the series.  The rest
+     of the names are ignored.
+
+     For example,
+
+          $(firstword foo bar)
+
+     produces the result `foo'.  Although `$(firstword TEXT)' is the
+     same as `$(word 1,TEXT)', the `firstword' function is retained for
+     its simplicity.
+
+`$(lastword NAMES...)'
+     The argument NAMES is regarded as a series of names, separated by
+     whitespace.  The value is the last name in the series.
+
+     For example,
+
+          $(lastword foo bar)
+
+     produces the result `bar'.  Although `$(lastword TEXT)' is the
+     same as `$(word $(words TEXT),TEXT)', the `lastword' function was
+     added for its simplicity and better performance.
+
+   Here is a realistic example of the use of `subst' and `patsubst'.
+Suppose that a makefile uses the `VPATH' variable to specify a list of
+directories that `make' should search for prerequisite files (*note
+`VPATH' Search Path for All Prerequisites: General Search.).  This
+example shows how to tell the C compiler to search for header files in
+the same list of directories.
+
+   The value of `VPATH' is a list of directories separated by colons,
+such as `src:../headers'.  First, the `subst' function is used to
+change the colons to spaces:
+
+     $(subst :, ,$(VPATH))
+
+This produces `src ../headers'.  Then `patsubst' is used to turn each
+directory name into a `-I' flag.  These can be added to the value of
+the variable `CFLAGS', which is passed automatically to the C compiler,
+like this:
+
+     override CFLAGS += $(patsubst %,-I%,$(subst :, ,$(VPATH)))
+
+The effect is to append the text `-Isrc -I../headers' to the previously
+given value of `CFLAGS'.  The `override' directive is used so that the
+new value is assigned even if the previous value of `CFLAGS' was
+specified with a command argument (*note The `override' Directive:
+Override Directive.).

+
+8.3 Functions for File Names
+============================
+
+Several of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to
+taking apart file names or lists of file names.
+
+   Each of the following functions performs a specific transformation
+on a file name.  The argument of the function is regarded as a series
+of file names, separated by whitespace.  (Leading and trailing
+whitespace is ignored.)  Each file name in the series is transformed in
+the same way and the results are concatenated with single spaces
+between them.
+
+`$(dir NAMES...)'
+     Extracts the directory-part of each file name in NAMES.  The
+     directory-part of the file name is everything up through (and
+     including) the last slash in it.  If the file name contains no
+     slash, the directory part is the string `./'.  For example,
+
+          $(dir src/foo.c hacks)
+
+     produces the result `src/ ./'.
+
+`$(notdir NAMES...)'
+     Extracts all but the directory-part of each file name in NAMES.
+     If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged.
+     Otherwise, everything through the last slash is removed from it.
+
+     A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string.  This
+     is unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always
+     have the same number of whitespace-separated file names as the
+     argument had; but we do not see any other valid alternative.
+
+     For example,
+
+          $(notdir src/foo.c hacks)
+
+     produces the result `foo.c hacks'.
+
+`$(suffix NAMES...)'
+     Extracts the suffix of each file name in NAMES.  If the file name
+     contains a period, the suffix is everything starting with the last
+     period.  Otherwise, the suffix is the empty string.  This
+     frequently means that the result will be empty when NAMES is not,
+     and if NAMES contains multiple file names, the result may contain
+     fewer file names.
+
+     For example,
+
+          $(suffix src/foo.c src-1.0/bar.c hacks)
+
+     produces the result `.c .c'.
+
+`$(basename NAMES...)'
+     Extracts all but the suffix of each file name in NAMES.  If the
+     file name contains a period, the basename is everything starting
+     up to (and not including) the last period.  Periods in the
+     directory part are ignored.  If there is no period, the basename
+     is the entire file name.  For example,
+
+          $(basename src/foo.c src-1.0/bar hacks)
+
+     produces the result `src/foo src-1.0/bar hacks'.
+
+`$(addsuffix SUFFIX,NAMES...)'
+     The argument NAMES is regarded as a series of names, separated by
+     whitespace; SUFFIX is used as a unit.  The value of SUFFIX is
+     appended to the end of each individual name and the resulting
+     larger names are concatenated with single spaces between them.
+     For example,
+
+          $(addsuffix .c,foo bar)
+
+     produces the result `foo.c bar.c'.
+
+`$(addprefix PREFIX,NAMES...)'
+     The argument NAMES is regarded as a series of names, separated by
+     whitespace; PREFIX is used as a unit.  The value of PREFIX is
+     prepended to the front of each individual name and the resulting
+     larger names are concatenated with single spaces between them.
+     For example,
+
+          $(addprefix src/,foo bar)
+
+     produces the result `src/foo src/bar'.
+
+`$(join LIST1,LIST2)'
+     Concatenates the two arguments word by word: the two first words
+     (one from each argument) concatenated form the first word of the
+     result, the two second words form the second word of the result,
+     and so on.  So the Nth word of the result comes from the Nth word
+     of each argument.  If one argument has more words that the other,
+     the extra words are copied unchanged into the result.
+
+     For example, `$(join a b,.c .o)' produces `a.c b.o'.
+
+     Whitespace between the words in the lists is not preserved; it is
+     replaced with a single space.
+
+     This function can merge the results of the `dir' and `notdir'
+     functions, to produce the original list of files which was given
+     to those two functions.
+
+`$(wildcard PATTERN)'
+     The argument PATTERN is a file name pattern, typically containing
+     wildcard characters (as in shell file name patterns).  The result
+     of `wildcard' is a space-separated list of the names of existing
+     files that match the pattern.  *Note Using Wildcard Characters in
+     File Names: Wildcards.
+
+`$(realpath NAMES...)'
+     For each file name in NAMES return the canonical absolute name.  A
+     canonical name does not contain any `.' or `..' components, nor
+     any repeated path separators (`/') or symlinks.  In case of a
+     failure the empty string is returned.  Consult the `realpath(3)'
+     documentation for a list of possible failure causes.
+
+`$(abspath NAMES...)'
+     For each file name in NAMES return an absolute name that does not
+     contain any `.' or `..' components, nor any repeated path
+     separators (`/').  Note that, in contrast to `realpath' function,
+     `abspath' does not resolve symlinks and does not require the file
+     names to refer to an existing file or directory.  Use the
+     `wildcard' function to test for existence.

+
+8.4 Functions for Conditionals
+==============================
+
+There are three functions that provide conditional expansion.  A key
+aspect of these functions is that not all of the arguments are expanded
+initially.  Only those arguments which need to be expanded, will be
+expanded.
+
+`$(if CONDITION,THEN-PART[,ELSE-PART])'
+     The `if' function provides support for conditional expansion in a
+     functional context (as opposed to the GNU `make' makefile
+     conditionals such as `ifeq' (*note Syntax of Conditionals:
+     Conditional Syntax.).
+
+     The first argument, CONDITION, first has all preceding and
+     trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded.  If it expands to
+     any non-empty string, then the condition is considered to be true.
+     If it expands to an empty string, the condition is considered to
+     be false.
+
+     If the condition is true then the second argument, THEN-PART, is
+     evaluated and this is used as the result of the evaluation of the
+     entire `if' function.
+
+     If the condition is false then the third argument, ELSE-PART, is
+     evaluated and this is the result of the `if' function.  If there is
+     no third argument, the `if' function evaluates to nothing (the
+     empty string).
+
+     Note that only one of the THEN-PART or the ELSE-PART will be
+     evaluated, never both.  Thus, either can contain side-effects
+     (such as `shell' function calls, etc.)
+
+`$(or CONDITION1[,CONDITION2[,CONDITION3...]])'
+     The `or' function provides a "short-circuiting" OR operation.
+     Each argument is expanded, in order.  If an argument expands to a
+     non-empty string the processing stops and the result of the
+     expansion is that string.  If, after all arguments are expanded,
+     all of them are false (empty), then the result of the expansion is
+     the empty string.
+
+`$(and CONDITION1[,CONDITION2[,CONDITION3...]])'
+     The `and' function provides a "short-circuiting" AND operation.
+     Each argument is expanded, in order.  If an argument expands to an
+     empty string the processing stops and the result of the expansion
+     is the empty string.  If all arguments expand to a non-empty
+     string then the result of the expansion is the expansion of the
+     last argument.

+
+8.5 The `foreach' Function
+==========================
+
+The `foreach' function is very different from other functions.  It
+causes one piece of text to be used repeatedly, each time with a
+different substitution performed on it.  It resembles the `for' command
+in the shell `sh' and the `foreach' command in the C-shell `csh'.
+
+   The syntax of the `foreach' function is:
+
+     $(foreach VAR,LIST,TEXT)
+
+The first two arguments, VAR and LIST, are expanded before anything
+else is done; note that the last argument, TEXT, is *not* expanded at
+the same time.  Then for each word of the expanded value of LIST, the
+variable named by the expanded value of VAR is set to that word, and
+TEXT is expanded.  Presumably TEXT contains references to that
+variable, so its expansion will be different each time.
+
+   The result is that TEXT is expanded as many times as there are
+whitespace-separated words in LIST.  The multiple expansions of TEXT
+are concatenated, with spaces between them, to make the result of
+`foreach'.
+
+   This simple example sets the variable `files' to the list of all
+files in the directories in the list `dirs':
+
+     dirs := a b c d
+     files := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(wildcard $(dir)/*))
+
+   Here TEXT is `$(wildcard $(dir)/*)'.  The first repetition finds the
+value `a' for `dir', so it produces the same result as `$(wildcard
+a/*)'; the second repetition produces the result of `$(wildcard b/*)';
+and the third, that of `$(wildcard c/*)'.
+
+   This example has the same result (except for setting `dirs') as the
+following example:
+
+     files := $(wildcard a/* b/* c/* d/*)
+
+   When TEXT is complicated, you can improve readability by giving it a
+name, with an additional variable:
+
+     find_files = $(wildcard $(dir)/*)
+     dirs := a b c d
+     files := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(find_files))
+
+Here we use the variable `find_files' this way.  We use plain `=' to
+define a recursively-expanding variable, so that its value contains an
+actual function call to be re-expanded under the control of `foreach';
+a simply-expanded variable would not do, since `wildcard' would be
+called only once at the time of defining `find_files'.
+
+   The `foreach' function has no permanent effect on the variable VAR;
+its value and flavor after the `foreach' function call are the same as
+they were beforehand.  The other values which are taken from LIST are
+in effect only temporarily, during the execution of `foreach'.  The
+variable VAR is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of
+`foreach'.  If VAR was undefined before the `foreach' function call, it
+is undefined after the call.  *Note The Two Flavors of Variables:
+Flavors.
+
+   You must take care when using complex variable expressions that
+result in variable names because many strange things are valid variable
+names, but are probably not what you intended.  For example,
+
+     files := $(foreach Esta-escrito-en-espanol!,b c ch,$(find_files))
+
+might be useful if the value of `find_files' references the variable
+whose name is `Esta-escrito-en-espanol!' (es un nombre bastante largo,
+no?), but it is more likely to be a mistake.

+
+8.6 The `file' Function
+=======================
+
+The `file' function allows the makefile to write to a file.  Two modes
+of writing are supported: overwrite, where the text is written to the
+beginning of the file and any existing content is lost, and append,
+where the text is written to the end of the file, preserving the
+existing content.  In all cases the file is created if it does not
+exist.
+
+   The syntax of the `file' function is:
+
+     $(file OP FILENAME,TEXT)
+
+   The operator OP can be either `>' which indicates overwrite mode, or
+`>>' which indicates append mode.  The FILENAME indicates the file to
+be written to.  There may optionally be whitespace between the operator
+and the file name.
+
+   When the `file' function is expanded all its arguments are expanded
+first, then the file indicated by FILENAME will be opened in the mode
+described by OP.  Finally TEXT will be written to the file.  If TEXT
+does not already end in a newline, a final newline will be written.
+The result of evaluating the `file' function is always the empty string.
+
+   It is a fatal error if the file cannot be opened for writing, or if
+the write operation fails.
+
+   For example, the `file' function can be useful if your build system
+has a limited command line size and your recipe runs a command that can
+accept arguments from a file as well.  Many commands use the convention
+that an argument prefixed with an `@' specifies a file containing more
+arguments.  Then you might write your recipe in this way:
+
+     program: $(OBJECTS)
+             $(file >$@.in,$^)
+             $(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in
+             @rm $@.in
+
+   If the command required each argument to be on a separate line of the
+input file, you might write your recipe like this:
+
+     program: $(OBJECTS)
+             $(file >$@.in,) $(foreach O,$^,$(file >>$@.in,$O))
+             $(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in
+             @rm $@.in

+8.7 The `call' Function
+=======================
+
+The `call' function is unique in that it can be used to create new
+parameterized functions.  You can write a complex expression as the
+value of a variable, then use `call' to expand it with different values.
+
+   The syntax of the `call' function is:
+
+     $(call VARIABLE,PARAM,PARAM,...)
+
+   When `make' expands this function, it assigns each PARAM to
+temporary variables `$(1)', `$(2)', etc.  The variable `$(0)' will
+contain VARIABLE.  There is no maximum number of parameter arguments.
+There is no minimum, either, but it doesn't make sense to use `call'
+with no parameters.
+
+   Then VARIABLE is expanded as a `make' variable in the context of
+these temporary assignments.  Thus, any reference to `$(1)' in the
+value of VARIABLE will resolve to the first PARAM in the invocation of
+`call'.
+
+   Note that VARIABLE is the _name_ of a variable, not a _reference_ to
+that variable.  Therefore you would not normally use a `$' or
+parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a variable
+reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)
+
+   If VARIABLE is the name of a built-in function, the built-in function
+is always invoked (even if a `make' variable by that name also exists).
+
+   The `call' function expands the PARAM arguments before assigning
+them to temporary variables.  This means that VARIABLE values
+containing references to built-in functions that have special expansion
+rules, like `foreach' or `if', may not work as you expect.
+
+   Some examples may make this clearer.
+
+   This macro simply reverses its arguments:
+
+     reverse = $(2) $(1)
+
+     foo = $(call reverse,a,b)
+
+Here FOO will contain `b a'.
+
+   This one is slightly more interesting: it defines a macro to search
+for the first instance of a program in `PATH':
+
+     pathsearch = $(firstword $(wildcard $(addsuffix /$(1),$(subst :, ,$(PATH)))))
+
+     LS := $(call pathsearch,ls)
+
+Now the variable LS contains `/bin/ls' or similar.
+
+   The `call' function can be nested.  Each recursive invocation gets
+its own local values for `$(1)', etc. that mask the values of
+higher-level `call'.  For example, here is an implementation of a "map"
+function:
+
+     map = $(foreach a,$(2),$(call $(1),$(a)))
+
+   Now you can MAP a function that normally takes only one argument,
+such as `origin', to multiple values in one step:
+
+     o = $(call map,origin,o map MAKE)
+
+   and end up with O containing something like `file file default'.
+
+   A final caution: be careful when adding whitespace to the arguments
+to `call'.  As with other functions, any whitespace contained in the
+second and subsequent arguments is kept; this can cause strange
+effects.  It's generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace when
+providing parameters to `call'.

+
+8.8 The `value' Function
+========================
+
+The `value' function provides a way for you to use the value of a
+variable _without_ having it expanded.  Please note that this does not
+undo expansions which have already occurred; for example if you create
+a simply expanded variable its value is expanded during the definition;
+in that case the `value' function will return the same result as using
+the variable directly.
+
+   The syntax of the `value' function is:
+
+     $(value VARIABLE)
+
+   Note that VARIABLE is the _name_ of a variable, not a _reference_ to
+that variable.  Therefore you would not normally use a `$' or
+parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a variable
+reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)
+
+   The result of this function is a string containing the value of
+VARIABLE, without any expansion occurring.  For example, in this
+makefile:
+
+     FOO = $PATH
+
+     all:
+             @echo $(FOO)
+             @echo $(value FOO)
+
+The first output line would be `ATH', since the "$P" would be expanded
+as a `make' variable, while the second output line would be the current
+value of your `$PATH' environment variable, since the `value' function
+avoided the expansion.
+
+   The `value' function is most often used in conjunction with the
+`eval' function (*note Eval Function::).
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Eval Function,  Next: Origin Function,  Prev: Value Function,  Up: Functions
+
+8.9 The `eval' Function
+=======================
+
+The `eval' function is very special: it allows you to define new
+makefile constructs that are not constant; which are the result of
+evaluating other variables and functions.  The argument to the `eval'
+function is expanded, then the results of that expansion are parsed as
+makefile syntax.  The expanded results can define new `make' variables,
+targets, implicit or explicit rules, etc.
+
+   The result of the `eval' function is always the empty string; thus,
+it can be placed virtually anywhere in a makefile without causing
+syntax errors.
+
+   It's important to realize that the `eval' argument is expanded
+_twice_; first by the `eval' function, then the results of that
+expansion are expanded again when they are parsed as makefile syntax.
+This means you may need to provide extra levels of escaping for "$"
+characters when using `eval'.  The `value' function (*note Value
+Function::) can sometimes be useful in these situations, to circumvent
+unwanted expansions.
+
+   Here is an example of how `eval' can be used; this example combines
+a number of concepts and other functions.  Although it might seem
+overly complex to use `eval' in this example, rather than just writing
+out the rules, consider two things: first, the template definition (in
+`PROGRAM_template') could need to be much more complex than it is here;
+and second, you might put the complex, "generic" part of this example
+into another makefile, then include it in all the individual makefiles.
+Now your individual makefiles are quite straightforward.
+
+     PROGRAMS    = server client
+
+     server_OBJS = server.o server_priv.o server_access.o
+     server_LIBS = priv protocol
+
+     client_OBJS = client.o client_api.o client_mem.o
+     client_LIBS = protocol
+
+     # Everything after this is generic
+
+     .PHONY: all
+     all: $(PROGRAMS)
+
+     define PROGRAM_template =
+      $(1): $$($(1)_OBJS) $$($(1)_LIBS:%=-l%)
+      ALL_OBJS   += $$($(1)_OBJS)
+     endef
+
+     $(foreach prog,$(PROGRAMS),$(eval $(call PROGRAM_template,$(prog))))
+
+     $(PROGRAMS):
+             $(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $@

+             rm -f $(ALL_OBJS) $(PROGRAMS)

+
+8.10 The `origin' Function
+==========================
+
+The `origin' function is unlike most other functions in that it does
+not operate on the values of variables; it tells you something _about_
+a variable.  Specifically, it tells you where it came from.
+
+   The syntax of the `origin' function is:
+
+     $(origin VARIABLE)
+
+   Note that VARIABLE is the _name_ of a variable to inquire about, not
+a _reference_ to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally use a
+`$' or parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a variable
+reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)
+
+   The result of this function is a string telling you how the variable
+VARIABLE was defined:
+
+`undefined'
+     if VARIABLE was never defined.
+
+`default'
+     if VARIABLE has a default definition, as is usual with `CC' and so
+     on.  *Note Variables Used by Implicit Rules: Implicit Variables.
+     Note that if you have redefined a default variable, the `origin'
+     function will return the origin of the later definition.
+
+`environment'
+     if VARIABLE was inherited from the environment provided to `make'.
+
+`environment override'
+     if VARIABLE was inherited from the environment provided to `make',
+     and is overriding a setting for VARIABLE in the makefile as a
+     result of the `-e' option (*note Summary of Options: Options
+     Summary.).
+
+`file'
+     if VARIABLE was defined in a makefile.
+
+`command line'
+     if VARIABLE was defined on the command line.
+
+`override'
+     if VARIABLE was defined with an `override' directive in a makefile
+     (*note The `override' Directive: Override Directive.).
+
+`automatic'
+     if VARIABLE is an automatic variable defined for the execution of
+     the recipe for each rule (*note Automatic Variables::).
+
+   This information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity)
+to determine if you want to believe the value of a variable.  For
+example, suppose you have a makefile `foo' that includes another
+makefile `bar'.  You want a variable `bletch' to be defined in `bar' if
+you run the command `make -f bar', even if the environment contains a
+definition of `bletch'.  However, if `foo' defined `bletch' before
+including `bar', you do not want to override that definition.  This
+could be done by using an `override' directive in `foo', giving that
+definition precedence over the later definition in `bar';
+unfortunately, the `override' directive would also override any command
+line definitions.  So, `bar' could include:
+
+     ifdef bletch
+     ifeq "$(origin bletch)" "environment"
+     bletch = barf, gag, etc.
+     endif
+     endif
+
+If `bletch' has been defined from the environment, this will redefine
+it.
+
+   If you want to override a previous definition of `bletch' if it came
+from the environment, even under `-e', you could instead write:
+
+     ifneq "$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))" ""
+     bletch = barf, gag, etc.
+     endif
+
+   Here the redefinition takes place if `$(origin bletch)' returns
+either `environment' or `environment override'.  *Note Functions for
+String Substitution and Analysis: Text Functions.

+
+8.11 The `flavor' Function
+==========================
+
+The `flavor' function, like the `origin' function, does not operate on
+the values of variables but rather it tells you something _about_ a
+variable.  Specifically, it tells you the flavor of a variable (*note
+The Two Flavors of Variables: Flavors.).
+
+   The syntax of the `flavor' function is:
+
+     $(flavor VARIABLE)
+
+   Note that VARIABLE is the _name_ of a variable to inquire about, not
+a _reference_ to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally use a
+`$' or parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a variable
+reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)
+
+   The result of this function is a string that identifies the flavor
+of the variable VARIABLE:
+
+`undefined'
+     if VARIABLE was never defined.
+
+`recursive'
+     if VARIABLE is a recursively expanded variable.
+
+`simple'
+     if VARIABLE is a simply expanded variable.

+
+8.12 Functions That Control Make
+================================
+
+These functions control the way make runs.  Generally, they are used to
+provide information to the user of the makefile or to cause make to stop
+if some sort of environmental error is detected.
+
+`$(error TEXT...)'
+     Generates a fatal error where the message is TEXT.  Note that the
+     error is generated whenever this function is evaluated.  So, if
+     you put it inside a recipe or on the right side of a recursive
+     variable assignment, it won't be evaluated until later.  The TEXT
+     will be expanded before the error is generated.
+
+     For example,
+
+          ifdef ERROR1
+          $(error error is $(ERROR1))
+          endif
+
+     will generate a fatal error during the read of the makefile if the
+     `make' variable `ERROR1' is defined.  Or,
+
+          ERR = $(error found an error!)
+
+          .PHONY: err
+          err: ; $(ERR)
+
+     will generate a fatal error while `make' is running, if the `err'
+     target is invoked.
+
+`$(warning TEXT...)'
+     This function works similarly to the `error' function, above,
+     except that `make' doesn't exit.  Instead, TEXT is expanded and
+     the resulting message is displayed, but processing of the makefile
+     continues.
+
+     The result of the expansion of this function is the empty string.
+
+`$(info TEXT...)'
+     This function does nothing more than print its (expanded)
+     argument(s) to standard output.  No makefile name or line number
+     is added.  The result of the expansion of this function is the
+     empty string.

+
+8.13 The `shell' Function
+=========================
+
+The `shell' function is unlike any other function other than the
+`wildcard' function (*note The Function `wildcard': Wildcard Function.)
+in that it communicates with the world outside of `make'.
+
+   The `shell' function performs the same function that backquotes
+(``') perform in most shells: it does "command expansion".  This means
+that it takes as an argument a shell command and evaluates to the
+output of the command.  The only processing `make' does on the result
+is to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a
+single space.  If there is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it
+will simply be removed.
+
+   The commands run by calls to the `shell' function are run when the
+function calls are expanded (*note How `make' Reads a Makefile: Reading
+Makefiles.).  Because this function involves spawning a new shell, you
+should carefully consider the performance implications of using the
+`shell' function within recursively expanded variables vs. simply
+expanded variables (*note The Two Flavors of Variables: Flavors.).
+
+   Here are some examples of the use of the `shell' function:
+
+     contents := $(shell cat foo)
+
+sets `contents' to the contents of the file `foo', with a space (rather
+than a newline) separating each line.
+
+     files := $(shell echo *.c)
+
+sets `files' to the expansion of `*.c'.  Unless `make' is using a very
+strange shell, this has the same result as `$(wildcard *.c)' (as long
+as at least one `.c' file exists).

+
+8.14 The `guile' Function
+=========================
+
+GNU make may be built with support for GNU Guile as an embedded
+extension language.  You can check the `.FEATURES' variable for the
+word `guile' to determine if your version of GNU make provides this
+capability.
+
+   GNU Guile implements the Scheme language.  A review of GNU Guile and
+the Scheme language and its features is beyond the scope of this
+manual: see the documentation for GNU Guile and Scheme.
+
+   If GNU Guile is available as an extension language, there will be one
+new `make' function available: `guile'.  The `guile' function takes one
+argument which is first expanded by `make' in the normal fashion, then
+passed to the GNU Guile evaluator.  The result of the evaluator is
+converted into a string and used as the expansion of the `guile'
+function in the makefile.
+
+   Similarly, there are Guile procedures exposed by `make' for use in
+Guile scripts.

+File: make.info,  Node: Guile Types,  Next: Guile Interface,  Prev: Guile Function,  Up: Guile Function
+
+8.14.1 Conversion of Guile Types
+--------------------------------
+
+There is only one "data type" in `make': a string.  GNU Guile, on the
+other hand, provides a rich variety of different data types.  An
+important aspect of the interface between `make' and GNU Guile is the
+conversion of Guile data types into `make' strings.
+
+   This conversion is relevant in two places: when a makefile invokes
+the `guile' function to evaluate a Guile expression, the result of that
+evaluation must be converted into a make string so it can be further
+evaluated by `make'.  And secondly, when a Guile script invokes one of
+the procedures exported by `make' the argument provided to the
+procedure must be converted into a string.
+
+   The conversion of Guile types into `make' strings is as below:
+
+`#f'
+     False is converted into the empty string: in `make' conditionals
+     the empty string is considered false.
+
+`#t'
+     True is converted to the string `#t': in `make' conditionals any
+     non-empty string is considered true.
+
+`symbol'
+
+`number'
+     A symbol or number is converted into the string representation of
+     that symbol or number.
+
+`character'
+     A printable character is converted to the same character.
+
+`string'
+     A string containing only printable characters is converted to the
+     same string.
+
+`list'
+     A list is converted recursively according to the above rules.  This
+     implies that any structured list will be flattened (that is, a
+     result of `'(a b (c d) e)' will be converted to the `make' string
+     `a b c d e').
+
+`other'
+     Any other Guile type results in an error.  In future versions of
+     `make', other Guile types may be converted.
+
+
+   The translation of `#f' (to the empty string) and `#t' (to the
+non-empty string `#t') is designed to allow you to use Guile boolean
+results directly as `make' boolean conditions.  For example:
+
+     $(if $(guile (access? "myfile" R_OK)),$(info myfile exists))
+
+   As a consequence of these conversion rules you must consider the
+result of your Guile script, as that result will be converted into a
+string and parsed by `make'.  If there is no natural result for the
+script (that is, the script exists solely for its side-effects), you
+should add `#f' as the final expression in order to avoid syntax errors
+in your makefile.

+
+8.14.2 Interfaces from Guile to `make'
+--------------------------------------
+
+In addition to the `guile' function available in makefiles, `make'
+exposes some procedures for use in your Guile scripts.  At startup
+`make' creates a new Guile module, `gnu make', and exports these
+procedures as public interfaces from that module:
+
+`gmk-expand'
+     This procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a
+     string.  The string is expanded by `make' using normal `make'
+     expansion rules.  The result of the expansion is converted into a
+     Guile string and provided as the result of the procedure.
+
+`gmk-eval'
+     This procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a
+     string.  The string is evaluated by `make' as if it were a
+     makefile.  This is the same capability available via the `eval'
+     function (*note Eval Function::).  The result of the `gmk-eval'
+     procedure is always the empty string.
+
+`gmk-var'
+     This procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a
+     string.  The string is assumed to be the name of a `make'
+     variable, which is then expanded.  The expansion is converted into
+     a string and provided as the result of the procedure.
+
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Guile Example,  Prev: Guile Interface,  Up: Guile Function
+
+8.14.3 Example Using Guile in `make'
+------------------------------------
+
+Here is a very simple example using GNU Guile to manage writing to a
+file.  These Guile procedures simply open a file, allow writing to the
+file (one string per line), and close the file.  Note that because we
+cannot store complex values such as Guile ports in `make' variables,
+we'll keep the port as a global variable in the Guile interpreter.
+
+   You can create Guile functions easily using `define'/`endef' to
+create a Guile script, then use the `guile' function to internalize it:
+
+     define GUILEIO
+     ;; A simple Guile IO library for GNU make
+
+     (define MKPORT #f)
+
+     (define (mkopen name mode)
+       (set! MKPORT (open-file name mode))
+       #f)
+
+     (define (mkwrite s)
+       (display s MKPORT)
+       (newline MKPORT)
+       #f)
+
+     (define (mkclose)
+       (close-port MKPORT)
+       #f)
+
+     #f
+     endef
+
+     # Internalize the Guile IO functions
+     $(guile $(GUILEIO))
+
+   If you have a significant amount of Guile support code, you might
+consider keeping it in a different file (e.g., `guileio.scm') and then
+loading it in your makefile using the `guile' function:
+
+     $(guile (load "guileio.scm"))
+
+   An advantage to this method is that when editing `guileio.scm', your
+editor will understand that this file contains Scheme syntax rather
+than makefile syntax.
+
+   Now you can use these Guile functions to create files.  Suppose you
+need to operate on a very large list, which cannot fit on the command
+line, but the utility you're using accepts the list as input as well:
+
+     prog: $(PREREQS)
+             @$(guile (mkopen "tmp.out" "w")) \
+              $(foreach X,$^,$(guile (mkwrite "$(X)"))) \
+              $(guile (mkclose))
+             $(LINK) < tmp.out
+
+   A more comprehensive suite of file manipulation procedures is
+possible of course.  You could, for example, maintain multiple output
+files at the same time by choosing a symbol for each one and using it
+as the key to a hash table, where the value is a port, then returning
+the symbol to be stored in a `make' variable.

+9 How to Run `make'
+*******************
+
+A makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more
+than one way.  The simplest use is to recompile every file that is out
+of date.  Usually, makefiles are written so that if you run `make' with
+no arguments, it does just that.
+
+   But you might want to update only some of the files; you might want
+to use a different compiler or different compiler options; you might
+want just to find out which files are out of date without changing them.
+
+   By giving arguments when you run `make', you can do any of these
+things and many others.
+
+   The exit status of `make' is always one of three values:
+`0'
+     The exit status is zero if `make' is successful.
+
+`2'
+     The exit status is two if `make' encounters any errors.  It will
+     print messages describing the particular errors.
+
+`1'
+     The exit status is one if you use the `-q' flag and `make'
+     determines that some target is not already up to date.  *Note

+9.1 Arguments to Specify the Makefile
+=====================================
+
+The way to specify the name of the makefile is with the `-f' or
+`--file' option (`--makefile' also works).  For example, `-f altmake'
+says to use the file `altmake' as the makefile.
+
+   If you use the `-f' flag several times and follow each `-f' with an
+argument, all the specified files are used jointly as makefiles.
+
+   If you do not use the `-f' or `--file' flag, the default is to try
+`GNUmakefile', `makefile', and `Makefile', in that order, and use the
+first of these three which exists or can be made (*note Writing
+Makefiles: Makefiles.).

+
+9.2 Arguments to Specify the Goals
+==================================
+
+The "goals" are the targets that `make' should strive ultimately to
+update.  Other targets are updated as well if they appear as
+prerequisites of goals, or prerequisites of prerequisites of goals, etc.
+
+   By default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not
+counting targets that start with a period).  Therefore, makefiles are
+usually written so that the first target is for compiling the entire
+program or programs they describe.  If the first rule in the makefile
+has several targets, only the first target in the rule becomes the
+default goal, not the whole list.  You can manage the selection of the
+default goal from within your makefile using the `.DEFAULT_GOAL'
+variable (*note Other Special Variables: Special Variables.).
+
+   You can also specify a different goal or goals with command line
+arguments to `make'.  Use the name of the goal as an argument.  If you
+specify several goals, `make' processes each of them in turn, in the
+order you name them.
+
+   Any target in the makefile may be specified as a goal (unless it
+starts with `-' or contains an `=', in which case it will be parsed as
+a switch or variable definition, respectively).  Even targets not in
+the makefile may be specified, if `make' can find implicit rules that
+say how to make them.
+
+   `Make' will set the special variable `MAKECMDGOALS' to the list of
+goals you specified on the command line.  If no goals were given on the
+command line, this variable is empty.  Note that this variable should
+be used only in special circumstances.
+
+   An example of appropriate use is to avoid including `.d' files
+during `clean' rules (*note Automatic Prerequisites::), so `make' won't
+create them only to immediately remove them again:
+
+     sources = foo.c bar.c
+
+     ifneq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),clean)
+     include $(sources:.c=.d)
+     endif
+
+   One use of specifying a goal is if you want to compile only a part of
+the program, or only one of several programs.  Specify as a goal each
+file that you wish to remake.  For example, consider a directory
+containing several programs, with a makefile that starts like this:
+
+     .PHONY: all
+     all: size nm ld ar as
+
+   If you are working on the program `size', you might want to say
+`make size' so that only the files of that program are recompiled.
+
+   Another use of specifying a goal is to make files that are not
+normally made.  For example, there may be a file of debugging output,
+or a version of the program that is compiled specially for testing,
+which has a rule in the makefile but is not a prerequisite of the
+default goal.
+
+   Another use of specifying a goal is to run the recipe associated with
+a phony target (*note Phony Targets::) or empty target (*note Empty
+Target Files to Record Events: Empty Targets.).  Many makefiles contain
+a phony target named `clean' which deletes everything except source
+files.  Naturally, this is done only if you request it explicitly with
+`make clean'.  Following is a list of typical phony and empty target
+names.  *Note Standard Targets::, for a detailed list of all the
+standard target names which GNU software packages use.
+
+`all'
+     Make all the top-level targets the makefile knows about.
+
+`clean'
+     Delete all files that are normally created by running `make'.
+
+`mostlyclean'
+     Like `clean', but may refrain from deleting a few files that people
+     normally don't want to recompile.  For example, the `mostlyclean'
+     target for GCC does not delete `libgcc.a', because recompiling it
+     is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
+
+`distclean'
+`realclean'
+`clobber'
+     Any of these targets might be defined to delete _more_ files than
+     `clean' does.  For example, this would delete configuration files
+     or links that you would normally create as preparation for
+     compilation, even if the makefile itself cannot create these files.
+
+`install'
+     Copy the executable file into a directory that users typically
+     search for commands; copy any auxiliary files that the executable
+     uses into the directories where it will look for them.
+
+`print'
+     Print listings of the source files that have changed.
+
+`tar'
+     Create a tar file of the source files.
+
+`shar'
+     Create a shell archive (shar file) of the source files.
+
+`dist'
+     Create a distribution file of the source files.  This might be a
+     tar file, or a shar file, or a compressed version of one of the
+     above, or even more than one of the above.
+
+`TAGS'
+     Update a tags table for this program.
+
+`check'
+`test'
+     Perform self tests on the program this makefile builds.

+
+9.3 Instead of Executing Recipes
+================================
+
+The makefile tells `make' how to tell whether a target is up to date,
+and how to update each target.  But updating the targets is not always
+what you want.  Certain options specify other activities for `make'.
+
+`-n'
+`--just-print'
+`--dry-run'
+`--recon'
+     "No-op".  Causes `make' to print the recipes that are needed to
+     make the targets up to date, but not actually execute them.  Note
+     that some recipes are still executed, even with this flag (*note
+     How the `MAKE' Variable Works: MAKE Variable.).  Also any recipes
+     needed to update included makefiles are still executed (*note How
+     Makefiles Are Remade: Remaking Makefiles.).
+
+`-t'
+`--touch'
+     "Touch".  Marks targets as up to date without actually changing
+     them.  In other words, `make' pretends to update the targets but
+     does not really change their contents; instead only their modified
+     times are updated.
+
+`-q'
+`--question'
+     "Question".  Silently check whether the targets are up to date, but
+     do not execute recipes; the exit code shows whether any updates are
+     needed.
+
+`-W FILE'
+`--what-if=FILE'
+`--assume-new=FILE'
+`--new-file=FILE'
+     "What if".  Each `-W' flag is followed by a file name.  The given
+     files' modification times are recorded by `make' as being the
+     present time, although the actual modification times remain the
+     same.  You can use the `-W' flag in conjunction with the `-n' flag
+     to see what would happen if you were to modify specific files.
+
+   With the `-n' flag, `make' prints the recipe that it would normally
+execute but usually does not execute it.
+
+   With the `-t' flag, `make' ignores the recipes in the rules and uses
+(in effect) the command `touch' for each target that needs to be
+remade.  The `touch' command is also printed, unless `-s' or `.SILENT'
+is used.  For speed, `make' does not actually invoke the program
+`touch'.  It does the work directly.
+
+   With the `-q' flag, `make' prints nothing and executes no recipes,
+but the exit status code it returns is zero if and only if the targets
+to be considered are already up to date.  If the exit status is one,
+then some updating needs to be done.  If `make' encounters an error,
+the exit status is two, so you can distinguish an error from a target
+that is not up to date.
+
+   It is an error to use more than one of these three flags in the same
+invocation of `make'.
+
+   The `-n', `-t', and `-q' options do not affect recipe lines that
+begin with `+' characters or contain the strings `$(MAKE)' or
+`${MAKE}'.  Note that only the line containing the `+' character or the
+strings `$(MAKE)' or `${MAKE}' is run regardless of these options.
+Other lines in the same rule are not run unless they too begin with `+'
+or contain `$(MAKE)' or `${MAKE}' (*Note How the `MAKE' Variable Works:
+MAKE Variable.)
+
+   The `-t' flag prevents phony targets (*note Phony Targets::) from
+being updated, unless there are recipe lines beginning with `+' or
+containing `$(MAKE)' or `${MAKE}'.
+
+   The `-W' flag provides two features:
+
+   * If you also use the `-n' or `-q' flag, you can see what `make'
+     would do if you were to modify some files.
+
+   * Without the `-n' or `-q' flag, when `make' is actually executing
+     recipes, the `-W' flag can direct `make' to act as if some files
+     had been modified, without actually running the recipes for those
+     files.
+
+   Note that the options `-p' and `-v' allow you to obtain other
+information about `make' or about the makefiles in use (*note Summary
+of Options: Options Summary.).

+
+9.4 Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files
+========================================
+
+Sometimes you may have changed a source file but you do not want to
+recompile all the files that depend on it.  For example, suppose you add
+a macro or a declaration to a header file that many other files depend
+on.  Being conservative, `make' assumes that any change in the header
+file requires recompilation of all dependent files, but you know that
+they do not need to be recompiled and you would rather not waste the
+time waiting for them to compile.
+
+   If you anticipate the problem before changing the header file, you
+can use the `-t' flag.  This flag tells `make' not to run the recipes
+in the rules, but rather to mark the target up to date by changing its
+last-modification date.  You would follow this procedure:
+
+  1. Use the command `make' to recompile the source files that really
+     need recompilation, ensuring that the object files are up-to-date
+     before you begin.
+
+  2. Make the changes in the header files.
+
+  3. Use the command `make -t' to mark all the object files as up to
+     date.  The next time you run `make', the changes in the header
+     files will not cause any recompilation.
+
+   If you have already changed the header file at a time when some files
+do need recompilation, it is too late to do this.  Instead, you can use
+the `-o FILE' flag, which marks a specified file as "old" (*note
+Summary of Options: Options Summary.).  This means that the file itself
+will not be remade, and nothing else will be remade on its account.
+Follow this procedure:
+
+  1. Recompile the source files that need compilation for reasons
+     independent of the particular header file, with `make -o
+     HEADERFILE'.  If several header files are involved, use a separate
+     `-o' option for each header file.
+
+  2. Touch all the object files with `make -t'.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Overriding,  Next: Testing,  Prev: Avoiding Compilation,  Up: Running
+
+9.5 Overriding Variables
+========================
+
+An argument that contains `=' specifies the value of a variable: `V=X'
+sets the value of the variable V to X.  If you specify a value in this
+way, all ordinary assignments of the same variable in the makefile are
+ignored; we say they have been "overridden" by the command line
+argument.
+
+   The most common way to use this facility is to pass extra flags to
+compilers.  For example, in a properly written makefile, the variable
+`CFLAGS' is included in each recipe that runs the C compiler, so a file
+`foo.c' would be compiled something like this:
+
+     cc -c $(CFLAGS) foo.c
+
+   Thus, whatever value you set for `CFLAGS' affects each compilation
+that occurs.  The makefile probably specifies the usual value for
+`CFLAGS', like this:
+
+     CFLAGS=-g
+
+   Each time you run `make', you can override this value if you wish.
+For example, if you say `make CFLAGS='-g -O'', each C compilation will
+be done with `cc -c -g -O'.  (This also illustrates how you can use
+quoting in the shell to enclose spaces and other special characters in
+the value of a variable when you override it.)
+
+   The variable `CFLAGS' is only one of many standard variables that
+exist just so that you can change them this way.  *Note Variables Used
+by Implicit Rules: Implicit Variables, for a complete list.
+
+   You can also program the makefile to look at additional variables of
+your own, giving the user the ability to control other aspects of how
+the makefile works by changing the variables.
+
+   When you override a variable with a command line argument, you can
+define either a recursively-expanded variable or a simply-expanded
+variable.  The examples shown above make a recursively-expanded
+variable; to make a simply-expanded variable, write `:=' or `::='
+instead of `='.  But, unless you want to include a variable reference
+or function call in the _value_ that you specify, it makes no
+difference which kind of variable you create.
+
+   There is one way that the makefile can change a variable that you
+have overridden.  This is to use the `override' directive, which is a
+line that looks like this: `override VARIABLE = VALUE' (*note The
+`override' Directive: Override Directive.).
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Testing,  Next: Options Summary,  Prev: Overriding,  Up: Running
+
+9.6 Testing the Compilation of a Program
+========================================
+
+Normally, when an error happens in executing a shell command, `make'
+gives up immediately, returning a nonzero status.  No further recipes
+are executed for any target.  The error implies that the goal cannot be
+correctly remade, and `make' reports this as soon as it knows.
+
+   When you are compiling a program that you have just changed, this is
+not what you want.  Instead, you would rather that `make' try compiling
+every file that can be tried, to show you as many compilation errors as
+possible.
+
+   On these occasions, you should use the `-k' or `--keep-going' flag.
+This tells `make' to continue to consider the other prerequisites of
+the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and
+returns nonzero status.  For example, after an error in compiling one
+object file, `make -k' will continue compiling other object files even
+though it already knows that linking them will be impossible.  In
+addition to continuing after failed shell commands, `make -k' will
+continue as much as possible after discovering that it does not know
+how to make a target or prerequisite file.  This will always cause an
+error message, but without `-k', it is a fatal error (*note Summary of
+Options: Options Summary.).
+
+   The usual behavior of `make' assumes that your purpose is to get the
+goals up to date; once `make' learns that this is impossible, it might
+as well report the failure immediately.  The `-k' flag says that the
+real purpose is to test as much as possible of the changes made in the
+program, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can
+correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This is why Emacs'
+`M-x compile' command passes the `-k' flag by default.

+
+9.7 Summary of Options
+======================
+
+Here is a table of all the options `make' understands:
+
+`-b'
+`-m'
+     These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of
+     `make'.
+
+`-B'
+`--always-make'
+     Consider all targets out-of-date.  GNU `make' proceeds to consider
+     targets and their prerequisites using the normal algorithms;
+     however, all targets so considered are always remade regardless of
+     the status of their prerequisites.  To avoid infinite recursion, if
+     `MAKE_RESTARTS' (*note Other Special Variables: Special
+     Variables.) is set to a number greater than 0 this option is
+     disabled when considering whether to remake makefiles (*note How
+     Makefiles Are Remade: Remaking Makefiles.).
+
+`-C DIR'
+`--directory=DIR'
+     Change to directory DIR before reading the makefiles.  If multiple
+     `-C' options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the
+     previous one: `-C / -C etc' is equivalent to `-C /etc'.  This is
+     typically used with recursive invocations of `make' (*note
+     Recursive Use of `make': Recursion.).
+
+`-d'
+     Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.  The
+     debugging information says which files are being considered for
+     remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what
+     results, which files actually need to be remade, which implicit
+     rules are considered and which are applied--everything interesting
+     about how `make' decides what to do.  The `-d' option is
+     equivalent to `--debug=a' (see below).
+
+`--debug[=OPTIONS]'
+     Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
+     Various levels and types of output can be chosen.  With no
+     arguments, print the "basic" level of debugging.  Possible
+     arguments are below; only the first character is considered, and
+     values must be comma- or space-separated.
+
+    `a (all)'
+          All types of debugging output are enabled.  This is
+          equivalent to using `-d'.
+
+    `b (basic)'
+          Basic debugging prints each target that was found to be
+          out-of-date, and whether the build was successful or not.
+
+    `v (verbose)'
+          A level above `basic'; includes messages about which
+          makefiles were parsed, prerequisites that did not need to be
+          rebuilt, etc.  This option also enables `basic' messages.
+
+    `i (implicit)'
+          Prints messages describing the implicit rule searches for
+          each target.  This option also enables `basic' messages.
+
+    `j (jobs)'
+          Prints messages giving details on the invocation of specific
+          sub-commands.
+
+    `m (makefile)'
+          By default, the above messages are not enabled while trying
+          to remake the makefiles.  This option enables messages while
+          rebuilding makefiles, too.  Note that the `all' option does
+          enable this option.  This option also enables `basic'
+          messages.
+
+`-e'
+`--environment-overrides'
+     Give variables taken from the environment precedence over
+     variables from makefiles.  *Note Variables from the Environment:
+     Environment.
+
+`--eval=STRING'
+     Evaluate STRING as makefile syntax.  This is a command-line
+     version of the `eval' function (*note Eval Function::).  The
+     evaluation is performed after the default rules and variables have
+     been defined, but before any makefiles are read.
+
+`-f FILE'
+`--file=FILE'
+`--makefile=FILE'
+     Read the file named FILE as a makefile.  *Note Writing Makefiles:
+     Makefiles.
+
+`-h'
+`--help'
+     Remind you of the options that `make' understands and then exit.
+
+`-i'
+`--ignore-errors'
+     Ignore all errors in recipes executed to remake files.  *Note
+     Errors in Recipes: Errors.
+
+`-I DIR'
+`--include-dir=DIR'
+     Specifies a directory DIR to search for included makefiles.  *Note
+     Including Other Makefiles: Include.  If several `-I' options are
+     used to specify several directories, the directories are searched
+     in the order specified.
+
+`-j [JOBS]'
+`--jobs[=JOBS]'
+     Specifies the number of recipes (jobs) to run simultaneously.
+     With no argument, `make' runs as many recipes simultaneously as
+     possible.  If there is more than one `-j' option, the last one is
+     effective.  *Note Parallel Execution: Parallel, for more
+     information on how recipes are run.  Note that this option is
+     ignored on MS-DOS.
+
+`-k'
+`--keep-going'
+     Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target that
+     failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be remade, the other
+     prerequisites of these targets can be processed all the same.
+     *Note Testing the Compilation of a Program: Testing.
+
+`-l [LOAD]'
+`--load-average[=LOAD]'
+`--max-load[=LOAD]'
+     Specifies that no new recipes should be started if there are other
+     recipes running and the load average is at least LOAD (a
+     floating-point number).  With no argument, removes a previous load
+     limit.  *Note Parallel Execution: Parallel.
+
+`-L'
+`--check-symlink-times'
+     On systems that support symbolic links, this option causes `make'
+     to consider the timestamps on any symbolic links in addition to the
+     timestamp on the file referenced by those links.  When this option
+     is provided, the most recent timestamp among the file and the
+     symbolic links is taken as the modification time for this target
+     file.
+
+`-n'
+`--just-print'
+`--dry-run'
+`--recon'
+     Print the recipe that would be executed, but do not execute it
+     (except in certain circumstances).  *Note Instead of Executing
+     Recipes: Instead of Execution.
+
+`-o FILE'
+`--old-file=FILE'
+`--assume-old=FILE'
+     Do not remake the file FILE even if it is older than its
+     prerequisites, and do not remake anything on account of changes in
+     FILE.  Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules
+     are ignored.  *Note Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files: Avoiding
+     Compilation.
+
+`-p'
+`--print-data-base'
+     Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from
+     reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise
+     specified.  This also prints the version information given by the
+     `-v' switch (see below).  To print the data base without trying to
+     remake any files, use `make -qp'.  To print the data base of
+     predefined rules and variables, use `make -p -f /dev/null'.  The
+     data base output contains file name and line number information for
+     recipe and variable definitions, so it can be a useful debugging
+     tool in complex environments.
+
+`-q'
+`--question'
+     "Question mode".  Do not run any recipes, or print anything; just
+     return an exit status that is zero if the specified targets are
+     already up to date, one if any remaking is required, or two if an
+     error is encountered.  *Note Instead of Executing Recipes: Instead
+     of Execution.
+
+`-r'
+`--no-builtin-rules'
+     Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules (*note Using Implicit
+     Rules: Implicit Rules.).  You can still define your own by writing
+     pattern rules (*note Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules:
+     Pattern Rules.).  The `-r' option also clears out the default list
+     of suffixes for suffix rules (*note Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules:
+     Suffix Rules.).  But you can still define your own suffixes with a
+     rule for `.SUFFIXES', and then define your own suffix rules.  Note
+     that only _rules_ are affected by the `-r' option; default
+     variables remain in effect (*note Variables Used by Implicit
+     Rules: Implicit Variables.); see the `-R' option below.
+
+`-R'
+`--no-builtin-variables'
+     Eliminate use of the built-in rule-specific variables (*note
+     Variables Used by Implicit Rules: Implicit Variables.).  You can
+     still define your own, of course.  The `-R' option also
+     automatically enables the `-r' option (see above), since it
+     doesn't make sense to have implicit rules without any definitions
+     for the variables that they use.
+
+`-s'
+`--silent'
+`--quiet'
+     Silent operation; do not print the recipes as they are executed.
+     *Note Recipe Echoing: Echoing.
+
+`-S'
+`--no-keep-going'
+`--stop'
+     Cancel the effect of the `-k' option.  This is never necessary
+     except in a recursive `make' where `-k' might be inherited from
+     the top-level `make' via `MAKEFLAGS' (*note Recursive Use of
+     `make': Recursion.)  or if you set `-k' in `MAKEFLAGS' in your
+     environment.
+
+`-t'
+`--touch'
+     Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
+     instead of running their recipes.  This is used to pretend that the
+     recipes were done, in order to fool future invocations of `make'.
+     *Note Instead of Executing Recipes: Instead of Execution.
+
+`--trace'
+     Print the entire recipe to be executed, even for recipes that are
+     normally silent (due to `.SILENT' or `@').  Also print the
+     makefile name and line number where the recipe was defined.
+
+`-v'
+`--version'
+     Print the version of the `make' program plus a copyright, a list
+     of authors, and a notice that there is no warranty; then exit.
+
+`-w'
+`--print-directory'
+     Print a message containing the working directory both before and
+     after executing the makefile.  This may be useful for tracking
+     down errors from complicated nests of recursive `make' commands.
+     *Note Recursive Use of `make': Recursion.  (In practice, you
+     rarely need to specify this option since `make' does it for you;
+     see *note The `--print-directory' Option: -w Option.)
+
+`--no-print-directory'
+     Disable printing of the working directory under `-w'.  This option
+     is useful when `-w' is turned on automatically, but you do not
+     want to see the extra messages.  *Note The `--print-directory'
+     Option: -w Option.
+
+`-W FILE'
+`--what-if=FILE'
+`--new-file=FILE'
+`--assume-new=FILE'
+     Pretend that the target FILE has just been modified.  When used

+     to modify that file.  Without `-n', it is almost the same as
+     running a `touch' command on the given file before running `make',
+     except that the modification time is changed only in the
+     imagination of `make'.  *Note Instead of Executing Recipes:
+     Instead of Execution.
+

+10 Using Implicit Rules
+***********************
+
+Certain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often.  For
+example, one customary way to make an object file is from a C source
+file using the C compiler, `cc'.
+
+   "Implicit rules" tell `make' how to use customary techniques so that
+you do not have to specify them in detail when you want to use them.
+For example, there is an implicit rule for C compilation.  File names
+determine which implicit rules are run.  For example, C compilation
+typically takes a `.c' file and makes a `.o' file.  So `make' applies
+the implicit rule for C compilation when it sees this combination of
+file name endings.
+
+   A chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, `make'
+will remake a `.o' file from a `.y' file by way of a `.c' file.
+
+   The built-in implicit rules use several variables in their recipes so
+that, by changing the values of the variables, you can change the way
+the implicit rule works.  For example, the variable `CFLAGS' controls
+the flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C
+compilation.
+
+   You can define your own implicit rules by writing "pattern rules".
+
+   "Suffix rules" are a more limited way to define implicit rules.
+Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are
+retained for compatibility.

+
+10.1 Using Implicit Rules
+=========================
+
+To allow `make' to find a customary method for updating a target file,
+all you have to do is refrain from specifying recipes yourself.  Either
+write a rule with no recipe, or don't write a rule at all.  Then `make'
+will figure out which implicit rule to use based on which kind of
+source file exists or can be made.
+
+   For example, suppose the makefile looks like this:
+
+     foo : foo.o bar.o
+             cc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
+
+Because you mention `foo.o' but do not give a rule for it, `make' will
+automatically look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it.
+This happens whether or not the file `foo.o' currently exists.
+
+   If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both a recipe and one or
+more prerequisites (the source files).  You would want to write a rule
+for `foo.o' with no recipe if you need to specify additional
+prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot
+supply.
+
+   Each implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns.
+There may be many implicit rules with the same target pattern.  For
+example, numerous rules make `.o' files: one, from a `.c' file with the
+C compiler; another, from a `.p' file with the Pascal compiler; and so
+on.  The rule that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites
+exist or can be made.  So, if you have a file `foo.c', `make' will run
+the C compiler; otherwise, if you have a file `foo.p', `make' will run
+the Pascal compiler; and so on.
+
+   Of course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule
+you want `make' to use, and you know it will choose that one because you
+know which possible prerequisite files are supposed to exist.  *Note
+Catalogue of Implicit Rules: Catalogue of Rules, for a catalogue of all
+the predefined implicit rules.
+
+   Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required
+prerequisites "exist or can be made".  A file "can be made" if it is
+mentioned explicitly in the makefile as a target or a prerequisite, or
+if an implicit rule can be recursively found for how to make it.  When
+an implicit prerequisite is the result of another implicit rule, we say
+that "chaining" is occurring.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained
+Rules.
+
+   In general, `make' searches for an implicit rule for each target, and
+for each double-colon rule, that has no recipe.  A file that is
+mentioned only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule
+specifies nothing, so implicit rule search happens for it.  *Note
+Implicit Rule Search Algorithm: Implicit Rule Search, for the details
+of how the search is done.
+
+   Note that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule
+search.  For example, consider this explicit rule:
+
+     foo.o: foo.p
+
+The prerequisite on `foo.p' does not necessarily mean that `make' will
+remake `foo.o' according to the implicit rule to make an object file, a
+`.o' file, from a Pascal source file, a `.p' file.  For example, if
+`foo.c' also exists, the implicit rule to make an object file from a C
+source file is used instead, because it appears before the Pascal rule
+in the list of predefined implicit rules (*note Catalogue of Implicit
+Rules: Catalogue of Rules.).
+
+   If you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has
+no recipe, you can give that target an empty recipe by writing a
+semicolon (*note Defining Empty Recipes: Empty Recipes.).

+
+10.2 Catalogue of Implicit Rules
+================================
+
+Here is a catalogue of predefined implicit rules which are always
+available unless the makefile explicitly overrides or cancels them.
+*Note Canceling Implicit Rules: Canceling Rules, for information on
+canceling or overriding an implicit rule.  The `-r' or
+`--no-builtin-rules' option cancels all predefined rules.
+
+   This manual only documents the default rules available on POSIX-based
+operating systems.  Other operating systems, such as VMS, Windows,
+OS/2, etc. may have different sets of default rules.  To see the full
+list of default rules and variables available in your version of GNU
+`make', run `make -p' in a directory with no makefile.
+
+   Not all of these rules will always be defined, even when the `-r'
+option is not given.  Many of the predefined implicit rules are
+implemented in `make' as suffix rules, so which ones will be defined
+depends on the "suffix list" (the list of prerequisites of the special
+target `.SUFFIXES').  The default suffix list is: `.out', `.a', `.ln',
+`.o', `.c', `.cc', `.C', `.cpp', `.p', `.f', `.F', `.m', `.r', `.y',
+`.l', `.ym', `.lm', `.s', `.S', `.mod', `.sym', `.def', `.h', `.info',
+`.dvi', `.tex', `.texinfo', `.texi', `.txinfo', `.w', `.ch' `.web',
+`.sh', `.elc', `.el'.  All of the implicit rules described below whose
+prerequisites have one of these suffixes are actually suffix rules.  If
+you modify the suffix list, the only predefined suffix rules in effect
+will be those named by one or two of the suffixes that are on the list
+you specify; rules whose suffixes fail to be on the list are disabled.
+*Note Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules, for full details on
+suffix rules.
+
+Compiling C programs
+     `N.o' is made automatically from `N.c' with a recipe of the form
+     `$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c'.
+
+Compiling C++ programs
+     `N.o' is made automatically from `N.cc', `N.cpp', or `N.C' with a
+     recipe of the form `$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c'.  We
+     encourage you to use the suffix `.cc' for C++ source files instead
+     of `.C'.
+
+Compiling Pascal programs
+     `N.o' is made automatically from `N.p' with the recipe `$(PC)
+     $(PFLAGS) -c'.
+
+Compiling Fortran and Ratfor programs
+     `N.o' is made automatically from `N.r', `N.F' or `N.f' by running
+     the Fortran compiler.  The precise recipe used is as follows:
+
+    `.f'
+          `$(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c'.
+
+    `.F'
+          `$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c'.
+
+    `.r'
+          `$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(RFLAGS) -c'.
+
+Preprocessing Fortran and Ratfor programs
+     `N.f' is made automatically from `N.r' or `N.F'.  This rule runs
+     just the preprocessor to convert a Ratfor or preprocessable
+     Fortran program into a strict Fortran program.  The precise recipe
+     used is as follows:
+
+    `.F'
+          `$(FC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(FFLAGS) -F'.
+
+    `.r'
+          `$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(RFLAGS) -F'.
+
+Compiling Modula-2 programs
+     `N.sym' is made from `N.def' with a recipe of the form `$(M2C)
+     $(M2FLAGS) $(DEFFLAGS)'.  `N.o' is made from `N.mod'; the form is:
+     `$(M2C) $(M2FLAGS) $(MODFLAGS)'.
+
+Assembling and preprocessing assembler programs
+     `N.o' is made automatically from `N.s' by running the assembler,
+     `as'.  The precise recipe is `$(AS) $(ASFLAGS)'.
+
+     `N.s' is made automatically from `N.S' by running the C
+     preprocessor, `cpp'.  The precise recipe is `$(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS)'.
+
+Linking a single object file
+     `N' is made automatically from `N.o' by running the linker
+     (usually called `ld') via the C compiler.  The precise recipe used
+     is `$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) N.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)'.
+
+     This rule does the right thing for a simple program with only one
+     source file.  It will also do the right thing if there are multiple
+     object files (presumably coming from various other source files),
+     one of which has a name matching that of the executable file.
+     Thus,
+
+          x: y.o z.o
+
+     when `x.c', `y.c' and `z.c' all exist will execute:
+
+          cc -c x.c -o x.o
+          cc -c y.c -o y.o
+          cc -c z.c -o z.o
+          cc x.o y.o z.o -o x
+          rm -f x.o
+          rm -f y.o
+          rm -f z.o
+
+     In more complicated cases, such as when there is no object file
+     whose name derives from the executable file name, you must write
+     an explicit recipe for linking.
+
+     Each kind of file automatically made into `.o' object files will
+     be automatically linked by using the compiler (`$(CC)', `$(FC)' or
+     `$(PC)'; the C compiler `$(CC)' is used to assemble `.s' files)
+     without the `-c' option.  This could be done by using the `.o'
+     object files as intermediates, but it is faster to do the
+     compiling and linking in one step, so that's how it's done.
+
+Yacc for C programs
+     `N.c' is made automatically from `N.y' by running Yacc with the
+     recipe `$(YACC) $(YFLAGS)'.
+
+Lex for C programs
+     `N.c' is made automatically from `N.l' by running Lex.  The actual
+     recipe is `$(LEX) $(LFLAGS)'.
+
+Lex for Ratfor programs
+     `N.r' is made automatically from `N.l' by running Lex.  The actual
+     recipe is `$(LEX) $(LFLAGS)'.
+
+     The convention of using the same suffix `.l' for all Lex files
+     regardless of whether they produce C code or Ratfor code makes it
+     impossible for `make' to determine automatically which of the two
+     languages you are using in any particular case.  If `make' is
+     called upon to remake an object file from a `.l' file, it must
+     guess which compiler to use.  It will guess the C compiler, because
+     that is more common.  If you are using Ratfor, make sure `make'
+     knows this by mentioning `N.r' in the makefile.  Or, if you are
+     using Ratfor exclusively, with no C files, remove `.c' from the
+     list of implicit rule suffixes with:
+
+          .SUFFIXES:
+          .SUFFIXES: .o .r .f .l ...
+
+Making Lint Libraries from C, Yacc, or Lex programs
+     `N.ln' is made from `N.c' by running `lint'.  The precise recipe
+     is `$(LINT) $(LINTFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -i'.  The same recipe is used
+     on the C code produced from `N.y' or `N.l'.
+
+TeX and Web
+     `N.dvi' is made from `N.tex' with the recipe `$(TEX)'.  `N.tex' is
+     made from `N.web' with `$(WEAVE)', or from `N.w' (and from `N.ch'
+     if it exists or can be made) with `$(CWEAVE)'.  `N.p' is made from
+     `N.web' with `$(TANGLE)' and `N.c' is made from `N.w' (and from
+     `N.ch' if it exists or can be made) with `$(CTANGLE)'.
+
+Texinfo and Info
+     `N.dvi' is made from `N.texinfo', `N.texi', or `N.txinfo', with
+     the recipe `$(TEXI2DVI) $(TEXI2DVI_FLAGS)'.  `N.info' is made from
+     `N.texinfo', `N.texi', or `N.txinfo', with the recipe
+     `$(MAKEINFO) $(MAKEINFO_FLAGS)'.
+
+RCS
+     Any file `N' is extracted if necessary from an RCS file named
+     either `N,v' or `RCS/N,v'.  The precise recipe used is
+     `$(CO) $(COFLAGS)'.  `N' will not be extracted from RCS if it
+     already exists, even if the RCS file is newer.  The rules for RCS
+     are terminal (*note Match-Anything Pattern Rules: Match-Anything
+     Rules.), so RCS files cannot be generated from another source;
+     they must actually exist.
+
+SCCS
+     Any file `N' is extracted if necessary from an SCCS file named
+     either `s.N' or `SCCS/s.N'.  The precise recipe used is
+     `$(GET) $(GFLAGS)'.  The rules for SCCS are terminal (*note
+     Match-Anything Pattern Rules: Match-Anything Rules.), so SCCS
+     files cannot be generated from another source; they must actually
+     exist.
+
+     For the benefit of SCCS, a file `N' is copied from `N.sh' and made
+     executable (by everyone).  This is for shell scripts that are
+     checked into SCCS.  Since RCS preserves the execution permission
+     of a file, you do not need to use this feature with RCS.
+
+     We recommend that you avoid using of SCCS.  RCS is widely held to
+     be superior, and is also free.  By choosing free software in place
+     of comparable (or inferior) proprietary software, you support the
+     free software movement.
+
+   Usually, you want to change only the variables listed in the table
+above, which are documented in the following section.
+
+   However, the recipes in built-in implicit rules actually use
+variables such as `COMPILE.c', `LINK.p', and `PREPROCESS.S', whose
+values contain the recipes listed above.
+
+   `make' follows the convention that the rule to compile a `.X' source
+file uses the variable `COMPILE.X'.  Similarly, the rule to produce an
+executable from a `.X' file uses `LINK.X'; and the rule to preprocess a
+`.X' file uses `PREPROCESS.X'.
+
+   Every rule that produces an object file uses the variable
+`OUTPUT_OPTION'.  `make' defines this variable either to contain `-o
+$@', or to be empty, depending on a compile-time option.  You need the
+`-o' option to ensure that the output goes into the right file when the
+source file is in a different directory, as when using `VPATH' (*note
+Directory Search::).  However, compilers on some systems do not accept
+a `-o' switch for object files.  If you use such a system, and use
+`VPATH', some compilations will put their output in the wrong place.  A
+possible workaround for this problem is to give `OUTPUT_OPTION' the
+value `; mv $*.o $@'.

+
+10.3 Variables Used by Implicit Rules
+=====================================
+
+The recipes in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain
+predefined variables.  You can alter the values of these variables in
+the makefile, with arguments to `make', or in the environment to alter
+how the implicit rules work without redefining the rules themselves.
+You can cancel all variables used by implicit rules with the `-R' or
+`--no-builtin-variables' option.
+
+   For example, the recipe used to compile a C source file actually says
+`$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)'.  The default values of the variables
+used are `cc' and nothing, resulting in the command `cc -c'.  By
+redefining `CC' to `ncc', you could cause `ncc' to be used for all C
+compilations performed by the implicit rule.  By redefining `CFLAGS' to
+be `-g', you could pass the `-g' option to each compilation.  _All_
+implicit rules that do C compilation use `$(CC)' to get the program
+name for the compiler and _all_ include `$(CFLAGS)' among the arguments
+given to the compiler.
+
+   The variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those
+that are names of programs (like `CC') and those that contain arguments
+for the programs (like `CFLAGS').  (The "name of a program" may also
+contain some command arguments, but it must start with an actual
+executable program name.)  If a variable value contains more than one
+argument, separate them with spaces.
+
+   The following tables describe of some of the more commonly-used
+predefined variables.  This list is not exhaustive, and the default
+values shown here may not be what `make' selects for your environment.
+To see the complete list of predefined variables for your instance of
+GNU `make' you can run `make -p' in a directory with no makefiles.
+
+   Here is a table of some of the more common variables used as names of

+     Program to convert a Texinfo source file into an Info file; default
+     `makeinfo'.  
+
+`TEX'
+     Program to make TeX DVI files from TeX source; default `tex'.  
+
+`TEXI2DVI'
+     Program to make TeX DVI files from Texinfo source; default
+     `texi2dvi'.  
+

+10.4 Chains of Implicit Rules
+=============================
+
+Sometimes a file can be made by a sequence of implicit rules.  For
+example, a file `N.o' could be made from `N.y' by running first Yacc
+and then `cc'.  Such a sequence is called a "chain".
+
+   If the file `N.c' exists, or is mentioned in the makefile, no
+special searching is required: `make' finds that the object file can be
+made by C compilation from `N.c'; later on, when considering how to
+make `N.c', the rule for running Yacc is used.  Ultimately both `N.c'
+and `N.o' are updated.
+
+   However, even if `N.c' does not exist and is not mentioned, `make'
+knows how to envision it as the missing link between `N.o' and `N.y'!
+In this case, `N.c' is called an "intermediate file".  Once `make' has
+decided to use the intermediate file, it is entered in the data base as
+if it had been mentioned in the makefile, along with the implicit rule
+that says how to create it.
+
+   Intermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other
+files.  But intermediate files are treated differently in two ways.
+
+   The first difference is what happens if the intermediate file does
+not exist.  If an ordinary file B does not exist, and `make' considers
+a target that depends on B, it invariably creates B and then updates
+the target from B.  But if B is an intermediate file, then `make' can
+leave well enough alone.  It won't bother updating B, or the ultimate
+target, unless some prerequisite of B is newer than that target or
+there is some other reason to update that target.
+
+   The second difference is that if `make' _does_ create B in order to
+update something else, it deletes B later on after it is no longer
+needed.  Therefore, an intermediate file which did not exist before
+`make' also does not exist after `make'.  `make' reports the deletion
+to you by printing a `rm -f' command showing which file it is deleting.
+
+   Ordinarily, a file cannot be intermediate if it is mentioned in the
+makefile as a target or prerequisite.  However, you can explicitly mark
+a file as intermediate by listing it as a prerequisite of the special
+target `.INTERMEDIATE'.  This takes effect even if the file is mentioned
+explicitly in some other way.
+
+   You can prevent automatic deletion of an intermediate file by
+marking it as a "secondary" file.  To do this, list it as a
+prerequisite of the special target `.SECONDARY'.  When a file is
+secondary, `make' will not create the file merely because it does not
+already exist, but `make' does not automatically delete the file.
+Marking a file as secondary also marks it as intermediate.
+
+   You can list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as `%.o')
+as a prerequisite of the special target `.PRECIOUS' to preserve
+intermediate files made by implicit rules whose target patterns match
+that file's name; see *note Interrupts::.  
+
+   A chain can involve more than two implicit rules.  For example, it is
+possible to make a file `foo' from `RCS/foo.y,v' by running RCS, Yacc
+and `cc'.  Then both `foo.y' and `foo.c' are intermediate files that
+are deleted at the end.
+
+   No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain.  This
+means that `make' will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as
+making `foo' from `foo.o.o' by running the linker twice.  This
+constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the
+search for an implicit rule chain.
+
+   There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that
+would otherwise be handled by rule chains.  For example, making `foo'
+from `foo.c' could be handled by compiling and linking with separate
+chained rules, using `foo.o' as an intermediate file.  But what
+actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the
+compilation and linking with a single `cc' command.  The optimized rule
+is used in preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes
+earlier in the ordering of rules.

+
+10.5 Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules
+==========================================
+
+You define an implicit rule by writing a "pattern rule".  A pattern
+rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the
+character `%' (exactly one of them).  The target is considered a
+pattern for matching file names; the `%' can match any nonempty
+substring, while other characters match only themselves.  The
+prerequisites likewise use `%' to show how their names relate to the
+target name.
+
+   Thus, a pattern rule `%.o : %.c' says how to make any file `STEM.o'
+from another file `STEM.c'.
+
+   Note that expansion using `%' in pattern rules occurs *after* any
+variable or function expansions, which take place when the makefile is
+read.  *Note How to Use Variables: Using Variables, and *note Functions

+
+10.5.1 Introduction to Pattern Rules
+------------------------------------
+
+A pattern rule contains the character `%' (exactly one of them) in the
+target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule.  The target
+is a pattern for matching file names; the `%' matches any nonempty
+substring, while other characters match only themselves.  
+
+   For example, `%.c' as a pattern matches any file name that ends in
+`.c'.  `s.%.c' as a pattern matches any file name that starts with
+`s.', ends in `.c' and is at least five characters long.  (There must
+be at least one character to match the `%'.)  The substring that the
+`%' matches is called the "stem".
+
+   `%' in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem
+that was matched by the `%' in the target.  In order for the pattern
+rule to apply, its target pattern must match the file name under
+consideration and all of its prerequisites (after pattern substitution)
+must name files that exist or can be made.  These files become
+prerequisites of the target.  
+
+   Thus, a rule of the form
+
+     %.o : %.c ; RECIPE...
+
+specifies how to make a file `N.o', with another file `N.c' as its
+prerequisite, provided that `N.c' exists or can be made.
+
+   There may also be prerequisites that do not use `%'; such a
+prerequisite attaches to every file made by this pattern rule.  These
+unvarying prerequisites are useful occasionally.
+
+   A pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain `%', or
+in fact any prerequisites at all.  Such a rule is effectively a general
+wildcard.  It provides a way to make any file that matches the target
+pattern.  *Note Last Resort::.
+
+   More than one pattern rule may match a target.  In this case `make'
+will choose the "best fit" rule.  *Note How Patterns Match: Pattern
+Match.
+
+   Pattern rules may have more than one target.  Unlike normal rules,
+this does not act as many different rules with the same prerequisites
+and recipe.  If a pattern rule has multiple targets, `make' knows that
+the rule's recipe is responsible for making all of the targets.  The
+recipe is executed only once to make all the targets.  When searching
+for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of a rule
+other than the one that matches the target in need of a rule are
+incidental: `make' worries only about giving a recipe and prerequisites
+to the file presently in question.  However, when this file's recipe is
+run, the other targets are marked as having been updated themselves.  
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Pattern Examples,  Next: Automatic Variables,  Prev: Pattern Intro,  Up: Pattern Rules
+
+10.5.2 Pattern Rule Examples
+----------------------------
+
+Here are some examples of pattern rules actually predefined in `make'.
+First, the rule that compiles `.c' files into `.o' files:
+
+     %.o : %.c
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@
+
+defines a rule that can make any file `X.o' from `X.c'.  The recipe
+uses the automatic variables `$@' and `$<' to substitute the names of
+the target file and the source file in each case where the rule applies
+(*note Automatic Variables::).
+
+   Here is a second built-in rule:
+
+     % :: RCS/%,v
+             $(CO) $(COFLAGS) $<
+
+defines a rule that can make any file `X' whatsoever from a
+corresponding file `X,v' in the sub-directory `RCS'.  Since the target
+is `%', this rule will apply to any file whatever, provided the
+appropriate prerequisite file exists.  The double colon makes the rule
+"terminal", which means that its prerequisite may not be an intermediate
+file (*note Match-Anything Pattern Rules: Match-Anything Rules.).
+
+   This pattern rule has two targets:
+
+     %.tab.c %.tab.h: %.y
+             bison -d $<
+
+This tells `make' that the recipe `bison -d X.y' will make both
+`X.tab.c' and `X.tab.h'.  If the file `foo' depends on the files
+`parse.tab.o' and `scan.o' and the file `scan.o' depends on the file
+`parse.tab.h', when `parse.y' is changed, the recipe `bison -d parse.y'
+will be executed only once, and the prerequisites of both `parse.tab.o'
+and `scan.o' will be satisfied.  (Presumably the file `parse.tab.o'
+will be recompiled from `parse.tab.c' and the file `scan.o' from
+`scan.c', while `foo' is linked from `parse.tab.o', `scan.o', and its
+other prerequisites, and it will execute happily ever after.)

+
+10.5.3 Automatic Variables
+--------------------------
+
+Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a `.c' file into a
+`.o' file: how do you write the `cc' command so that it operates on the
+right source file name?  You cannot write the name in the recipe,
+because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.
+
+   What you do is use a special feature of `make', the "automatic
+variables".  These variables have values computed afresh for each rule
+that is executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule.
+In this example, you would use `$@' for the object file name and `$<'
+for the source file name.
+
+   It's very important that you recognize the limited scope in which
+automatic variable values are available: they only have values within
+the recipe.  In particular, you cannot use them anywhere within the
+target list of a rule; they have no value there and will expand to the
+empty string.  Also, they cannot be accessed directly within the
+prerequisite list of a rule.  A common mistake is attempting to use
+`$@' within the prerequisites list; this will not work.  However, there
+is a special feature of GNU `make', secondary expansion (*note
+Secondary Expansion::), which will allow automatic variable values to
+be used in prerequisite lists.
+
+   Here is a table of automatic variables:
+
+`$@'
+     The file name of the target of the rule.  If the target is an
+     archive member, then `$@' is the name of the archive file.  In a
+     pattern rule that has multiple targets (*note Introduction to
+     Pattern Rules: Pattern Intro.), `$@' is the name of whichever
+     target caused the rule's recipe to be run.
+
+`$%'
+     The target member name, when the target is an archive member.
+     *Note Archives::.  For example, if the target is `foo.a(bar.o)'
+     then `$%' is `bar.o' and `$@' is `foo.a'.  `$%' is empty when the
+     target is not an archive member.
+
+`$<'
+     The name of the first prerequisite.  If the target got its recipe
+     from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added
+     by the implicit rule (*note Implicit Rules::).
+
+`$?'
+     The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target,
+     with spaces between them.  For prerequisites which are archive
+     members, only the named member is used (*note Archives::).  
+
+`$^'
+     The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  For
+     prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is
+     used (*note Archives::).  A target has only one prerequisite on
+     each other file it depends on, no matter how many times each file
+     is listed as a prerequisite.  So if you list a prerequisite more
+     than once for a target, the value of `$^' contains just one copy
+     of the name.  This list does *not* contain any of the order-only
+     prerequisites; for those see the `$|' variable, below.  
+
+`$+'
+     This is like `$^', but prerequisites listed more than once are
+     duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile.  This is
+     primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is
+     meaningful to repeat library file names in a particular order.
+
+`$|'
+     The names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between
+     them.
+
+`$*'
+     The stem with which an implicit rule matches (*note How Patterns
+     Match: Pattern Match.).  If the target is `dir/a.foo.b' and the
+     target pattern is `a.%.b' then the stem is `dir/foo'.  The stem is
+     useful for constructing names of related files.  
+
+     In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that
+     matched the `%' in the target pattern.
+
+     In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so `$*' cannot be determined
+     in that way.  Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized
+     suffix (*note Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules.), `$*' is
+     set to the target name minus the suffix.  For example, if the
+     target name is `foo.c', then `$*' is set to `foo', since `.c' is a
+     suffix.  GNU `make' does this bizarre thing only for compatibility
+     with other implementations of `make'.  You should generally avoid
+     using `$*' except in implicit rules or static pattern rules.
+
+     If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a
+     recognized suffix, `$*' is set to the empty string for that rule.
+
+   `$?' is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on
+only the prerequisites that have changed.  For example, suppose that an
+archive named `lib' is supposed to contain copies of several object
+files.  This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:
+
+     lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
+             ar r lib $?
+
+   Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file
+names, and three have values that are lists of file names.  These seven
+have variants that get just the file's directory name or just the file
+name within the directory.  The variant variables' names are formed by
+appending `D' or `F', respectively.  These variants are semi-obsolete
+in GNU `make' since the functions `dir' and `notdir' can be used to get
+a similar effect (*note Functions for File Names: File Name
+Functions.).  Note, however, that the `D' variants all omit the
+trailing slash which always appears in the output of the `dir'
+function.  Here is a table of the variants:
+
+`$(@D)'
+     The directory part of the file name of the target, with the
+     trailing slash removed.  If the value of `$@' is `dir/foo.o' then
+     `$(@D)' is `dir'.  This value is `.' if `$@' does not contain a
+     slash.
+
+`$(@F)'
+     The file-within-directory part of the file name of the target.  If
+     the value of `$@' is `dir/foo.o' then `$(@F)' is `foo.o'.  `$(@F)'
+     is equivalent to `$(notdir $@)'.
+
+`$(*D)'
+`$(*F)'
+     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the stem;
+     `dir' and `foo' in this example.
+
+`$(%D)'
+`$(%F)'
+     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target
+     archive member name.  This makes sense only for archive member
+     targets of the form `ARCHIVE(MEMBER)' and is useful only when
+     MEMBER may contain a directory name.  (*Note Archive Members as
+     Targets: Archive Members.)
+
+`$(<D)'
+`$(<F)'
+     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the first
+     prerequisite.
+
+`$(^D)'
+`$(^F)'
+     Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts
+     of all prerequisites.
+
+`$(+D)'
+`$(+F)'
+     Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts
+     of all prerequisites, including multiple instances of duplicated
+     prerequisites.
+
+`$(?D)'
+`$(?F)'
+     Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of
+     all prerequisites that are newer than the target.
+
+   Note that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about
+these automatic variables; we write "the value of `$<'", rather than
+"the variable `<'" as we would write for ordinary variables such as
+`objects' and `CFLAGS'.  We think this convention looks more natural in
+this special case.  Please do not assume it has a deep significance;
+`$<' refers to the variable named `<' just as `$(CFLAGS)' refers to the
+variable named `CFLAGS'.  You could just as well use `$(<)' in place of
+`$<'.

+
+10.5.4 How Patterns Match
+-------------------------
+
+A target pattern is composed of a `%' between a prefix and a suffix,
+either or both of which may be empty.  The pattern matches a file name
+only if the file name starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix,
+without overlap.  The text between the prefix and the suffix is called
+the "stem".  Thus, when the pattern `%.o' matches the file name
+`test.o', the stem is `test'.  The pattern rule prerequisites are
+turned into actual file names by substituting the stem for the character
+`%'.  Thus, if in the same example one of the prerequisites is written
+as `%.c', it expands to `test.c'.
+
+   When the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does
+not), directory names in the file names are removed from the file name
+before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix.  After the
+comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory names,
+along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the prerequisite
+file names generated from the pattern rule's prerequisite patterns and
+the file name.  The directories are ignored only for the purpose of
+finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of that rule.
+Thus, `e%t' matches the file name `src/eat', with `src/a' as the stem.
+When prerequisites are turned into file names, the directories from the
+stem are added at the front, while the rest of the stem is substituted
+for the `%'.  The stem `src/a' with a prerequisite pattern `c%r' gives
+the file name `src/car'.
+
+   A pattern rule can be used to build a given file only if there is a
+target pattern that matches the file name, _and_ all prerequisites in
+that rule either exist or can be built.  The rules you write take
+precedence over those that are built in. Note however, that a rule
+whose prerequisites actually exist or are mentioned always takes
+priority over a rule with prerequisites that must be made by chaining
+other implicit rules.
+
+   It is possible that more than one pattern rule will meet these
+criteria.  In that case, `make' will choose the rule with the shortest
+stem (that is, the pattern that matches most specifically).  If more
+than one pattern rule has the shortest stem, `make' will choose the
+first one found in the makefile.
+
+   This algorithm results in more specific rules being preferred over
+more generic ones; for example:
+
+     %.o: %.c
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@
+
+     %.o : %.f
+             $(COMPILE.F) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $<
+
+     lib/%.o: lib/%.c
+             $(CC) -fPIC -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@
+
+   Given these rules and asked to build `bar.o' where both `bar.c' and
+`bar.f' exist, `make' will choose the first rule and compile `bar.c'
+into `bar.o'.  In the same situation where `bar.c' does not exist, then
+`make' will choose the second rule and compile `bar.f' into `bar.o'.
+
+   If `make' is asked to build `lib/bar.o' and both `lib/bar.c' and
+`lib/bar.f' exist, then the third rule will be chosen since the stem
+for this rule (`bar') is shorter than the stem for the first rule
+(`lib/bar').  If `lib/bar.c' does not exist then the third rule is not
+eligible and the second rule will be used, even though the stem is
+longer.

+
+10.5.5 Match-Anything Pattern Rules
+-----------------------------------
+
+When a pattern rule's target is just `%', it matches any file name
+whatever.  We call these rules "match-anything" rules.  They are very
+useful, but it can take a lot of time for `make' to think about them,
+because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed
+either as a target or as a prerequisite.
+
+   Suppose the makefile mentions `foo.c'.  For this target, `make'
+would have to consider making it by linking an object file `foo.c.o',
+or by C compilation-and-linking in one step from `foo.c.c', or by
+Pascal compilation-and-linking from `foo.c.p', and many other
+possibilities.
+
+   We know these possibilities are ridiculous since `foo.c' is a C
+source file, not an executable.  If `make' did consider these
+possibilities, it would ultimately reject them, because files such as
+`foo.c.o' and `foo.c.p' would not exist.  But these possibilities are so
+numerous that `make' would run very slowly if it had to consider them.
+
+   To gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way `make'
+considers match-anything rules.  There are two different constraints
+that can be applied, and each time you define a match-anything rule you
+must choose one or the other for that rule.
+
+   One choice is to mark the match-anything rule as "terminal" by
+defining it with a double colon.  When a rule is terminal, it does not
+apply unless its prerequisites actually exist.  Prerequisites that
+could be made with other implicit rules are not good enough.  In other
+words, no further chaining is allowed beyond a terminal rule.
+
+   For example, the built-in implicit rules for extracting sources from
+RCS and SCCS files are terminal; as a result, if the file `foo.c,v' does
+not exist, `make' will not even consider trying to make it as an
+intermediate file from `foo.c,v.o' or from `RCS/SCCS/s.foo.c,v'.  RCS
+and SCCS files are generally ultimate source files, which should not be
+remade from any other files; therefore, `make' can save time by not
+looking for ways to remake them.
+
+   If you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is
+non-terminal.  A non-terminal match-anything rule cannot apply to a
+file name that indicates a specific type of data.  A file name
+indicates a specific type of data if some non-match-anything implicit
+rule target matches it.
+
+   For example, the file name `foo.c' matches the target for the pattern
+rule `%.c : %.y' (the rule to run Yacc).  Regardless of whether this
+rule is actually applicable (which happens only if there is a file
+`foo.y'), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent
+consideration of any non-terminal match-anything rules for the file
+`foo.c'.  Thus, `make' will not even consider trying to make `foo.c' as
+an executable file from `foo.c.o', `foo.c.c', `foo.c.p', etc.
+
+   The motivation for this constraint is that non-terminal
+match-anything rules are used for making files containing specific
+types of data (such as executable files) and a file name with a
+recognized suffix indicates some other specific type of data (such as a
+C source file).
+
+   Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize
+certain file names so that non-terminal match-anything rules will not be
+considered.  These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no recipes, and
+they are ignored for all other purposes.  For example, the built-in
+implicit rule
+
+     %.p :
+
+exists to make sure that Pascal source files such as `foo.p' match a
+specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted
+looking for `foo.p.o' or `foo.p.c'.
+
+   Dummy pattern rules such as the one for `%.p' are made for every
+suffix listed as valid for use in suffix rules (*note Old-Fashioned
+Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules.).

+
+10.5.6 Canceling Implicit Rules
+-------------------------------
+
+You can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined

+prerequisites, but a different recipe.  When the new rule is defined,
+the built-in one is replaced.  The new rule's position in the sequence
+of implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.
+
+   You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule
+with the same target and prerequisites, but no recipe.  For example,
+the following would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:

+
+10.6 Defining Last-Resort Default Rules
+=======================================
+
+You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal
+match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (*note Match-Anything
+Rules::).  This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing
+special about it is that it will match any target.  So such a rule's
+recipe is used for all targets and prerequisites that have no recipe of
+their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.
+
+   For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the
+source files contain real data, only that they exist.  Then you might
+do this:
+
+     %::
+             touch $@
+
+to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created
+automatically.
+
+   You can instead define a recipe to be used for targets for which
+there are no rules at all, even ones which don't specify recipes.  You
+do this by writing a rule for the target `.DEFAULT'.  Such a rule's
+recipe is used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets in
+any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies.  Naturally,
+there is no `.DEFAULT' rule unless you write one.
+
+   If you use `.DEFAULT' with no recipe or prerequisites:
+
+     .DEFAULT:
+
+the recipe previously stored for `.DEFAULT' is cleared.  Then `make'
+acts as if you had never defined `.DEFAULT' at all.
+
+   If you do not want a target to get the recipe from a match-anything
+pattern rule or `.DEFAULT', but you also do not want any recipe to be
+run for the target, you can give it an empty recipe (*note Defining
+Empty Recipes: Empty Recipes.).
+
+   You can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile.

+
+10.7 Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules
+===============================
+
+"Suffix rules" are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rules for
+`make'.  Suffix rules are obsolete because pattern rules are more
+general and clearer.  They are supported in GNU `make' for
+compatibility with old makefiles.  They come in two kinds:
+"double-suffix" and "single-suffix".
+
+   A double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target
+suffix and the source suffix.  It matches any file whose name ends with
+the target suffix.  The corresponding implicit prerequisite is made by
+replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the file name.  A
+two-suffix rule whose target and source suffixes are `.o' and `.c' is
+equivalent to the pattern rule `%.o : %.c'.
+
+   A single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the
+source suffix.  It matches any file name, and the corresponding implicit
+prerequisite name is made by appending the source suffix.  A
+single-suffix rule whose source suffix is `.c' is equivalent to the
+pattern rule `% : %.c'.
+
+   Suffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule's
+target against a defined list of known suffixes.  When `make' sees a
+rule whose target is a known suffix, this rule is considered a
+single-suffix rule.  When `make' sees a rule whose target is two known
+suffixes concatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.
+
+   For example, `.c' and `.o' are both on the default list of known
+suffixes.  Therefore, if you define a rule whose target is `.c.o',
+`make' takes it to be a double-suffix rule with source suffix `.c' and
+target suffix `.o'.  Here is the old-fashioned way to define the rule
+for compiling a C source file:
+
+     .c.o:
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<
+
+   Suffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own.  If they
+have any, they are treated as normal files with funny names, not as
+suffix rules.  Thus, the rule:
+
+     .c.o: foo.h
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<
+
+tells how to make the file `.c.o' from the prerequisite file `foo.h',
+and is not at all like the pattern rule:
+
+     %.o: %.c foo.h
+             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<
+
+which tells how to make `.o' files from `.c' files, and makes all `.o'
+files using this pattern rule also depend on `foo.h'.
+
+   Suffix rules with no recipe are also meaningless.  They do not remove
+previous rules as do pattern rules with no recipe (*note Canceling
+Implicit Rules: Canceling Rules.).  They simply enter the suffix or
+pair of suffixes concatenated as a target in the data base.
+
+   The known suffixes are simply the names of the prerequisites of the
+special target `.SUFFIXES'.  You can add your own suffixes by writing a
+rule for `.SUFFIXES' that adds more prerequisites, as in:
+
+     .SUFFIXES: .hack .win
+
+which adds `.hack' and `.win' to the end of the list of suffixes.
+
+   If you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just
+adding to them, write a rule for `.SUFFIXES' with no prerequisites.  By
+special dispensation, this eliminates all existing prerequisites of
+`.SUFFIXES'.  You can then write another rule to add the suffixes you
+want.  For example,
+
+     .SUFFIXES:            # Delete the default suffixes
+     .SUFFIXES: .c .o .h   # Define our suffix list
+
+   The `-r' or `--no-builtin-rules' flag causes the default list of
+suffixes to be empty.
+
+   The variable `SUFFIXES' is defined to the default list of suffixes
+before `make' reads any makefiles.  You can change the list of suffixes
+with a rule for the special target `.SUFFIXES', but that does not alter
+this variable.

+
+10.8 Implicit Rule Search Algorithm
+===================================
+
+Here is the procedure `make' uses for searching for an implicit rule
+for a target T.  This procedure is followed for each double-colon rule
+with no recipe, for each target of ordinary rules none of which have a
+recipe, and for each prerequisite that is not the target of any rule.
+It is also followed recursively for prerequisites that come from
+implicit rules, in the search for a chain of rules.
+
+   Suffix rules are not mentioned in this algorithm because suffix
+rules are converted to equivalent pattern rules once the makefiles have
+been read in.
+
+   For an archive member target of the form `ARCHIVE(MEMBER)', the
+following algorithm is run twice, first using the entire target name T,
+and second using `(MEMBER)' as the target T if the first run found no
+rule.
+
+  1. Split T into a directory part, called D, and the rest, called N.
+     For example, if T is `src/foo.o', then D is `src/' and N is
+     `foo.o'.
+
+  2. Make a list of all the pattern rules one of whose targets matches
+     T or N.  If the target pattern contains a slash, it is matched
+     against T; otherwise, against N.
+
+  3. If any rule in that list is _not_ a match-anything rule, then
+     remove all non-terminal match-anything rules from the list.
+
+  4. Remove from the list all rules with no recipe.
+
+  5. For each pattern rule in the list:
+
+       a. Find the stem S, which is the nonempty part of T or N matched
+          by the `%' in the target pattern.
+
+       b. Compute the prerequisite names by substituting S for `%'; if
+          the target pattern does not contain a slash, append D to the
+          front of each prerequisite name.
+
+       c. Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.
+          (If a file name is mentioned in the makefile as a target or
+          as an explicit prerequisite, then we say it ought to exist.)
+
+          If all prerequisites exist or ought to exist, or there are no
+          prerequisites, then this rule applies.
+
+  6. If no pattern rule has been found so far, try harder.  For each
+     pattern rule in the list:
+
+       a. If the rule is terminal, ignore it and go on to the next rule.
+
+       b. Compute the prerequisite names as before.
+
+       c. Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.
+
+       d. For each prerequisite that does not exist, follow this
+          algorithm recursively to see if the prerequisite can be made
+          by an implicit rule.
+
+       e. If all prerequisites exist, ought to exist, or can be made by
+          implicit rules, then this rule applies.
+
+  7. If no implicit rule applies, the rule for `.DEFAULT', if any,
+     applies.  In that case, give T the same recipe that `.DEFAULT'
+     has.  Otherwise, there is no recipe for T.
+
+   Once a rule that applies has been found, for each target pattern of
+the rule other than the one that matched T or N, the `%' in the pattern
+is replaced with S and the resultant file name is stored until the
+recipe to remake the target file T is executed.  After the recipe is
+executed, each of these stored file names are entered into the data
+base and marked as having been updated and having the same update
+status as the file T.
+
+   When the recipe of a pattern rule is executed for T, the automatic
+variables are set corresponding to the target and prerequisites.  *Note
+Automatic Variables::.

+11 Using `make' to Update Archive Files
+***************************************

+they are maintained with the program `ar' and their main use is as
+subroutine libraries for linking.
+

+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Archive Members,  Next: Archive Update,  Prev: Archives,  Up: Archives
+
+11.1 Archive Members as Targets
+===============================
+
+An individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or
+prerequisite in `make'.  You specify the member named MEMBER in archive
+file ARCHIVE as follows:
+
+     ARCHIVE(MEMBER)
+
+This construct is available only in targets and prerequisites, not in
+recipes!  Most programs that you might use in recipes do not support
+this syntax and cannot act directly on archive members.  Only `ar' and
+other programs specifically designed to operate on archives can do so.
+Therefore, valid recipes to update an archive member target probably
+must use `ar'.  For example, this rule says to create a member `hack.o'
+in archive `foolib' by copying the file `hack.o':
+
+     foolib(hack.o) : hack.o
+             ar cr foolib hack.o
+
+   In fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this
+way and there is an implicit rule to do it for you.  *Please note:* The
+`c' flag to `ar' is required if the archive file does not already exist.
+
+   To specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the
+member names together between the parentheses.  For example:
+
+     foolib(hack.o kludge.o)
+
+is equivalent to:
+
+     foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)
+
+   You can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member
+reference.  *Note Using Wildcard Characters in File Names: Wildcards.
+For example, `foolib(*.o)' expands to all existing members of the
+`foolib' archive whose names end in `.o'; perhaps `foolib(hack.o)
+foolib(kludge.o)'.
+

+
+11.2 Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets
+=============================================
+
+Recall that a target that looks like `A(M)' stands for the member named
+M in the archive file A.
+
+   When `make' looks for an implicit rule for such a target, as a
+special feature it considers implicit rules that match `(M)', as well as
+those that match the actual target `A(M)'.
+
+   This causes one special rule whose target is `(%)' to match.  This
+rule updates the target `A(M)' by copying the file M into the archive.
+For example, it will update the archive member target `foo.a(bar.o)' by
+copying the _file_ `bar.o' into the archive `foo.a' as a _member_ named
+`bar.o'.
+
+   When this rule is chained with others, the result is very powerful.
+Thus, `make "foo.a(bar.o)"' (the quotes are needed to protect the `('
+and `)' from being interpreted specially by the shell) in the presence
+of a file `bar.c' is enough to cause the following recipe to be run,
+even without a makefile:
+
+     cc -c bar.c -o bar.o
+     ar r foo.a bar.o
+     rm -f bar.o
+
+Here `make' has envisioned the file `bar.o' as an intermediate file.
+*Note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.
+
+   Implicit rules such as this one are written using the automatic
+variable `$%'.  *Note Automatic Variables::.
+
+   An archive member name in an archive cannot contain a directory
+name, but it may be useful in a makefile to pretend that it does.  If
+you write an archive member target `foo.a(dir/file.o)', `make' will
+perform automatic updating with this recipe:
+
+     ar r foo.a dir/file.o
+
+which has the effect of copying the file `dir/file.o' into a member
+named `file.o'.  In connection with such usage, the automatic variables
+`%D' and `%F' may be useful.

+
+11.2.1 Updating Archive Symbol Directories
+------------------------------------------
+
+An archive file that is used as a library usually contains a special
+member named `__.SYMDEF' that contains a directory of the external
+symbol names defined by all the other members.  After you update any
+other members, you need to update `__.SYMDEF' so that it will summarize
+the other members properly.  This is done by running the `ranlib'
+program:
+
+     ranlib ARCHIVEFILE
+
+   Normally you would put this command in the rule for the archive file,
+and make all the members of the archive file prerequisites of that rule.
+For example,
+
+     libfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o) libfoo.a(y.o) ...
+             ranlib libfoo.a
+
+The effect of this is to update archive members `x.o', `y.o', etc., and
+then update the symbol directory member `__.SYMDEF' by running
+`ranlib'.  The rules for updating the members are not shown here; most
+likely you can omit them and use the implicit rule which copies files
+into the archive, as described in the preceding section.
+
+   This is not necessary when using the GNU `ar' program, which updates
+the `__.SYMDEF' member automatically.

+
+11.3 Dangers When Using Archives
+================================
+
+It is important to be careful when using parallel execution (the `-j'
+switch; *note Parallel Execution: Parallel.) and archives.  If multiple
+`ar' commands run at the same time on the same archive file, they will
+not know about each other and can corrupt the file.
+
+   Possibly a future version of `make' will provide a mechanism to
+circumvent this problem by serializing all recipes that operate on the
+same archive file.  But for the time being, you must either write your
+makefiles to avoid this problem in some other way, or not use `-j'.
+

+File: make.info,  Node: Archive Suffix Rules,  Prev: Archive Pitfalls,  Up: Archives
+
+11.4 Suffix Rules for Archive Files
+===================================
+
+You can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive
+files.  *Note Suffix Rules::, for a full explanation of suffix rules.
+Archive suffix rules are obsolete in GNU `make', because pattern rules
+for archives are a more general mechanism (*note Archive Update::).
+But they are retained for compatibility with other `make's.
+
+   To write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule
+using the target suffix `.a' (the usual suffix for archive files).  For
+example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to update a library
+archive from C source files:
+
+     .c.a:
+             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $< -o $*.o
+             $(AR) r $@ $*.o
+             $(RM) $*.o
+
+This works just as if you had written the pattern rule:
+
+     (%.o): %.c
+             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $< -o $*.o
+             $(AR) r $@ $*.o
+             $(RM) $*.o
+
+   In fact, this is just what `make' does when it sees a suffix rule
+with `.a' as the target suffix.  Any double-suffix rule `.X.a' is
+converted to a pattern rule with the target pattern `(%.o)' and a
+prerequisite pattern of `%.X'.
+
+   Since you might want to use `.a' as the suffix for some other kind
+of file, `make' also converts archive suffix rules to pattern rules in
+the normal way (*note Suffix Rules::).  Thus a double-suffix rule
+`.X.a' produces two pattern rules: `(%.o): %.X' and `%.a: %.X'.

+12 Features of GNU `make'
+*************************
+
+Here is a summary of the features of GNU `make', for comparison with
+and credit to other versions of `make'.  We consider the features of
+`make' in 4.2 BSD systems as a baseline.  If you are concerned with
+writing portable makefiles, you should not use the features of `make'
+listed here, nor the ones in *note Missing::.
+
+   Many features come from the version of `make' in System V.
+
+   * The `VPATH' variable and its special meaning.  *Note Searching
+     Directories for Prerequisites: Directory Search.  This feature
+     exists in System V `make', but is undocumented.  It is documented
+     in 4.3 BSD `make' (which says it mimics System V's `VPATH'
+     feature).
+
+   * Included makefiles.  *Note Including Other Makefiles: Include.
+     Allowing multiple files to be included with a single directive is
+     a GNU extension.
+
+   * Variables are read from and communicated via the environment.
+     *Note Variables from the Environment: Environment.
+
+   * Options passed through the variable `MAKEFLAGS' to recursive
+     invocations of `make'.  *Note Communicating Options to a
+     Sub-`make': Options/Recursion.
+
+   * The automatic variable `$%' is set to the member name in an
+     archive reference.  *Note Automatic Variables::.
+
+   * The automatic variables `$@', `$*', `$<', `$%', and `$?' have
+     corresponding forms like `$(@F)' and `$(@D)'.  We have generalized
+     this to `$^' as an obvious extension.  *Note Automatic Variables::.
+
+   * Substitution variable references.  *Note Basics of Variable
+     References: Reference.
+
+   * The command line options `-b' and `-m', accepted and ignored.  In
+     System V `make', these options actually do something.
+
+   * Execution of recursive commands to run `make' via the variable
+     `MAKE' even if `-n', `-q' or `-t' is specified.  *Note Recursive
+     Use of `make': Recursion.
+
+   * Support for suffix `.a' in suffix rules.  *Note Archive Suffix
+     Rules::.  This feature is obsolete in GNU `make', because the
+     general feature of rule chaining (*note Chains of Implicit Rules:
+     Chained Rules.) allows one pattern rule for installing members in
+     an archive (*note Archive Update::) to be sufficient.
+
+   * The arrangement of lines and backslash/newline combinations in
+     recipes is retained when the recipes are printed, so they appear as
+     they do in the makefile, except for the stripping of initial
+     whitespace.
+
+   The following features were inspired by various other versions of
+`make'.  In some cases it is unclear exactly which versions inspired
+which others.
+
+   * Pattern rules using `%'.  This has been implemented in several
+     versions of `make'.  We're not sure who invented it first, but
+     it's been spread around a bit.  *Note Defining and Redefining
+     Pattern Rules: Pattern Rules.
+
+   * Rule chaining and implicit intermediate files.  This was
+     implemented by Stu Feldman in his version of `make' for AT&T
+     Eighth Edition Research Unix, and later by Andrew Hume of AT&T
+     Bell Labs in his `mk' program (where he terms it "transitive
+     closure").  We do not really know if we got this from either of
+     them or thought it up ourselves at the same time.  *Note Chains of
+     Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.
+
+   * The automatic variable `$^' containing a list of all prerequisites
+     of the current target.  We did not invent this, but we have no
+     idea who did.  *Note Automatic Variables::.  The automatic variable
+     `$+' is a simple extension of `$^'.
+
+   * The "what if" flag (`-W' in GNU `make') was (as far as we know)
+     invented by Andrew Hume in `mk'.  *Note Instead of Executing
+     Recipes: Instead of Execution.
+
+   * The concept of doing several things at once (parallelism) exists in
+     many incarnations of `make' and similar programs, though not in the
+     System V or BSD implementations.  *Note Recipe Execution:
+     Execution.
+
+   * Modified variable references using pattern substitution come from
+     SunOS 4.  *Note Basics of Variable References: Reference.  This
+     functionality was provided in GNU `make' by the `patsubst'
+     function before the alternate syntax was implemented for
+     compatibility with SunOS 4.  It is not altogether clear who
+     inspired whom, since GNU `make' had `patsubst' before SunOS 4 was
+     released.
+
+   * The special significance of `+' characters preceding recipe lines
+     (*note Instead of Executing Recipes: Instead of Execution.) is
+     mandated by `IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992' (POSIX.2).
+
+   * The `+=' syntax to append to the value of a variable comes from
+     SunOS 4 `make'.  *Note Appending More Text to Variables: Appending.
+
+   * The syntax `ARCHIVE(MEM1 MEM2...)' to list multiple members in a
+     single archive file comes from SunOS 4 `make'.  *Note Archive
+     Members::.
+
+   * The `-include' directive to include makefiles with no error for a
+     nonexistent file comes from SunOS 4 `make'.  (But note that SunOS 4
+     `make' does not allow multiple makefiles to be specified in one
+     `-include' directive.)  The same feature appears with the name
+     `sinclude' in SGI `make' and perhaps others.
+
+   * The `!=' shell assignment operator exists in many BSD of `make'
+     and is purposefully implemented here to behave identically to
+     those implementations.
+
+   The remaining features are inventions new in GNU `make':
+
+   * Use the `-v' or `--version' option to print version and copyright
+     information.
+
+   * Use the `-h' or `--help' option to summarize the options to `make'.
+
+   * Simply-expanded variables.  *Note The Two Flavors of Variables:
+     Flavors.
+
+   * Pass command line variable assignments automatically through the
+     variable `MAKE' to recursive `make' invocations.  *Note Recursive
+     Use of `make': Recursion.
+
+   * Use the `-C' or `--directory' command option to change directory.
+     *Note Summary of Options: Options Summary.
+
+   * Make verbatim variable definitions with `define'.  *Note Defining
+     Multi-Line Variables: Multi-Line.
+
+   * Declare phony targets with the special target `.PHONY'.
+
+     Andrew Hume of AT&T Bell Labs implemented a similar feature with a
+     different syntax in his `mk' program.  This seems to be a case of
+     parallel discovery.  *Note Phony Targets: Phony Targets.
+
+   * Manipulate text by calling functions.  *Note Functions for
+     Transforming Text: Functions.
+
+   * Use the `-o' or `--old-file' option to pretend a file's
+     modification-time is old.  *Note Avoiding Recompilation of Some
+     Files: Avoiding Compilation.
+
+   * Conditional execution.
+
+     This feature has been implemented numerous times in various
+     versions of `make'; it seems a natural extension derived from the
+     features of the C preprocessor and similar macro languages and is
+     not a revolutionary concept.  *Note Conditional Parts of
+     Makefiles: Conditionals.
+
+   * Specify a search path for included makefiles.  *Note Including
+     Other Makefiles: Include.

+13 Incompatibilities and Missing Features
+*****************************************
+
+The `make' programs in various other systems support a few features
+that are not implemented in GNU `make'.  The POSIX.2 standard (`IEEE
+Standard 1003.2-1992') which specifies `make' does not require any of
+these features.
+
+   * A target of the form `FILE((ENTRY))' stands for a member of
+     archive file FILE.  The member is chosen, not by name, but by
+     being an object file which defines the linker symbol ENTRY.
+
+     This feature was not put into GNU `make' because of the
+     non-modularity of putting knowledge into `make' of the internal
+     format of archive file symbol tables.  *Note Updating Archive
+     Symbol Directories: Archive Symbols.
+
+   * Suffixes (used in suffix rules) that end with the character `~'
+     have a special meaning to System V `make'; they refer to the SCCS
+     file that corresponds to the file one would get without the `~'.
+     For example, the suffix rule `.c~.o' would make the file `N.o' from
+     the SCCS file `s.N.c'.  For complete coverage, a whole series of
+     such suffix rules is required.  *Note Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules:
+     Suffix Rules.
+
+     In GNU `make', this entire series of cases is handled by two
+     pattern rules for extraction from SCCS, in combination with the
+     general feature of rule chaining.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules:
+     Chained Rules.
+
+   * In System V and 4.3 BSD `make', files found by `VPATH' search
+     (*note Searching Directories for Prerequisites: Directory Search.)
+     have their names changed inside recipes.  We feel it is much
+     cleaner to always use automatic variables and thus make this
+     feature obsolete.
+
+   * In some Unix `make's, the automatic variable `$*' appearing in the
+     prerequisites of a rule has the amazingly strange "feature" of
+     expanding to the full name of the _target of that rule_.  We cannot
+     imagine what went on in the minds of Unix `make' developers to do
+     this; it is utterly inconsistent with the normal definition of
+     `$*'.  
+
+   * In some Unix `make's, implicit rule search (*note Using Implicit
+     Rules: Implicit Rules.) is apparently done for _all_ targets, not
+     just those without recipes.  This means you can do:
+
+          foo.o:
+                  cc -c foo.c
+
+     and Unix `make' will intuit that `foo.o' depends on `foo.c'.
+
+     We feel that such usage is broken.  The prerequisite properties of
+     `make' are well-defined (for GNU `make', at least), and doing such
+     a thing simply does not fit the model.
+
+   * GNU `make' does not include any built-in implicit rules for
+     compiling or preprocessing EFL programs.  If we hear of anyone who
+     is using EFL, we will gladly add them.
+
+   * It appears that in SVR4 `make', a suffix rule can be specified
+     with no recipe, and it is treated as if it had an empty recipe
+     (*note Empty Recipes::).  For example:
+
+          .c.a:
+
+     will override the built-in `.c.a' suffix rule.
+
+     We feel that it is cleaner for a rule without a recipe to always
+     simply add to the prerequisite list for the target.  The above
+     example can be easily rewritten to get the desired behavior in GNU
+     `make':
+
+          .c.a: ;
+
+   * Some versions of `make' invoke the shell with the `-e' flag,
+     except under `-k' (*note Testing the Compilation of a Program:
+     Testing.).  The `-e' flag tells the shell to exit as soon as any
+     program it runs returns a nonzero status.  We feel it is cleaner to
+     write each line of the recipe to stand on its own and not require
+     this special treatment.

+
+14.1 General Conventions for Makefiles
+======================================
+
+Every Makefile should contain this line:
+
+     SHELL = /bin/sh
+
+to avoid trouble on systems where the `SHELL' variable might be
+inherited from the environment.  (This is never a problem with GNU
+`make'.)
+
+   Different `make' programs have incompatible suffix lists and
+implicit rules, and this sometimes creates confusion or misbehavior.  So
+it is a good idea to set the suffix list explicitly using only the
+suffixes you need in the particular Makefile, like this:
+
+     .SUFFIXES:
+     .SUFFIXES: .c .o
+
+The first line clears out the suffix list, the second introduces all
+suffixes which may be subject to implicit rules in this Makefile.
+
+   Don't assume that `.' is in the path for command execution.  When
+you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the
+make, please make sure that it uses `./' if the program is built as
+part of the make or `$(srcdir)/' if the file is an unchanging part of
+the source code.  Without one of these prefixes, the current search
+path is used.
+
+   The distinction between `./' (the "build directory") and
+`$(srcdir)/' (the "source directory") is important because users can
+build in a separate directory using the `--srcdir' option to
+`configure'.  A rule of the form:
+
+     foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
+             sed -f sedscript foo.man > foo.1
+
+will fail when the build directory is not the source directory, because
+`foo.man' and `sedscript' are in the source directory.
+
+   When using GNU `make', relying on `VPATH' to find the source file
+will work in the case where there is a single dependency file, since
+the `make' automatic variable `$<' will represent the source file
+wherever it is.  (Many versions of `make' set `$<' only in implicit
+rules.)  A Makefile target like
+
+     foo.o : bar.c
+             $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c bar.c -o foo.o
+
+should instead be written as
+
+     foo.o : bar.c
+             $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
+
+in order to allow `VPATH' to work correctly.  When the target has
+multiple dependencies, using an explicit `$(srcdir)' is the easiest way
+to make the rule work well.  For example, the target above for `foo.1'
+is best written as:
+
+     foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
+             sed -f $(srcdir)/sedscript $(srcdir)/foo.man > $@
+
+   GNU distributions usually contain some files which are not source
+files--for example, Info files, and the output from Autoconf, Automake,
+Bison or Flex.  Since these files normally appear in the source
+directory, they should always appear in the source directory, not in the
+build directory.  So Makefile rules to update them should put the
+updated files in the source directory.
+
+   However, if a file does not appear in the distribution, then the
+Makefile should not put it in the source directory, because building a
+program in ordinary circumstances should not modify the source directory
+in any way.
+
+   Try to make the build and installation targets, at least (and all
+their subtargets) work correctly with a parallel `make'.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Utilities in Makefiles,  Next: Command Variables,  Prev: Makefile Basics,  Up: Makefile Conventions
+
+14.2 Utilities in Makefiles
+===========================
+
+Write the Makefile commands (and any shell scripts, such as
+`configure') to run under `sh' (both the traditional Bourne shell and
+the POSIX shell), not `csh'.  Don't use any special features of `ksh'
+or `bash', or POSIX features not widely supported in traditional Bourne
+`sh'.
+
+   The `configure' script and the Makefile rules for building and
+installation should not use any utilities directly except these:
+
+     awk cat cmp cp diff echo egrep expr false grep install-info ln ls
+     mkdir mv printf pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch tr true
+
+   Compression programs such as `gzip' can be used in the `dist' rule.
+
+   Generally, stick to the widely-supported (usually POSIX-specified)
+options and features of these programs.  For example, don't use `mkdir
+-p', convenient as it may be, because a few systems don't support it at
+all and with others, it is not safe for parallel execution.  For a list
+of known incompatibilities, see *note Portable Shell Programming:
+(autoconf)Portable Shell.
+
+   It is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles,
+since a few file systems don't support them.
+
+   The Makefile rules for building and installation can also use
+compilers and related programs, but should do so via `make' variables
+so that the user can substitute alternatives.  Here are some of the
+programs we mean:
+
+     ar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex
+     make makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc
+
+   Use the following `make' variables to run those programs:
+
+     $(AR) $(BISON) $(CC) $(FLEX) $(INSTALL) $(LD) $(LDCONFIG) $(LEX)
+     $(MAKE) $(MAKEINFO) $(RANLIB) $(TEXI2DVI) $(YACC)
+
+   When you use `ranlib' or `ldconfig', you should make sure nothing
+bad happens if the system does not have the program in question.
+Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before
+the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean
+a problem.  (The Autoconf `AC_PROG_RANLIB' macro can help with this.)
+
+   If you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for
+systems that don't have symbolic links.
+
+   Additional utilities that can be used via Make variables are:
+
+     chgrp chmod chown mknod
+
+   It is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts)
+intended only for particular systems where you know those utilities
+exist.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Command Variables,  Next: DESTDIR,  Prev: Utilities in Makefiles,  Up: Makefile Conventions
+
+14.3 Variables for Specifying Commands
+======================================
+
+Makefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands,
+options, and so on.
+
+   In particular, you should run most utility programs via variables.
+Thus, if you use Bison, have a variable named `BISON' whose default
+value is set with `BISON = bison', and refer to it with `$(BISON)'
+whenever you need to use Bison.
+
+   File management utilities such as `ln', `rm', `mv', and so on, need
+not be referred to through variables in this way, since users don't
+need to replace them with other programs.
+
+   Each program-name variable should come with an options variable that
+is used to supply options to the program.  Append `FLAGS' to the
+program-name variable name to get the options variable name--for
+example, `BISONFLAGS'.  (The names `CFLAGS' for the C compiler,
+`YFLAGS' for yacc, and `LFLAGS' for lex, are exceptions to this rule,
+but we keep them because they are standard.)  Use `CPPFLAGS' in any
+compilation command that runs the preprocessor, and use `LDFLAGS' in
+any compilation command that does linking as well as in any direct use
+of `ld'.
+
+   If there are C compiler options that _must_ be used for proper
+compilation of certain files, do not include them in `CFLAGS'.  Users
+expect to be able to specify `CFLAGS' freely themselves.  Instead,
+arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler independently
+of `CFLAGS', by writing them explicitly in the compilation commands or
+by defining an implicit rule, like this:
+
+     CFLAGS = -g
+     ALL_CFLAGS = -I. $(CFLAGS)
+     .c.o:
+             $(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $<
+
+   Do include the `-g' option in `CFLAGS', because that is not
+_required_ for proper compilation.  You can consider it a default that
+is only recommended.  If the package is set up so that it is compiled
+with GCC by default, then you might as well include `-O' in the default
+value of `CFLAGS' as well.
+
+   Put `CFLAGS' last in the compilation command, after other variables
+containing compiler options, so the user can use `CFLAGS' to override
+the others.
+
+   `CFLAGS' should be used in every invocation of the C compiler, both
+those which do compilation and those which do linking.
+
+   Every Makefile should define the variable `INSTALL', which is the
+basic command for installing a file into the system.
+
+   Every Makefile should also define the variables `INSTALL_PROGRAM'
+and `INSTALL_DATA'.  (The default for `INSTALL_PROGRAM' should be
+`$(INSTALL)'; the default for `INSTALL_DATA' should be `${INSTALL} -m
+644'.)  Then it should use those variables as the commands for actual
+installation, for executables and non-executables respectively.
+Minimal use of these variables is as follows:
+
+     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo
+     $(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a
+
+   However, it is preferable to support a `DESTDIR' prefix on the
+target files, as explained in the next section.
+
+   It is acceptable, but not required, to install multiple files in one
+command, with the final argument being a directory, as in:
+
+     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo bar baz $(bindir)
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: DESTDIR,  Next: Directory Variables,  Prev: Command Variables,  Up: Makefile Conventions
+
+14.4 `DESTDIR': Support for Staged Installs
+===========================================
+
+`DESTDIR' is a variable prepended to each installed target file, like
+this:
+
+     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/foo
+     $(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(DESTDIR)$(libdir)/libfoo.a
+
+   The `DESTDIR' variable is specified by the user on the `make'
+command line as an absolute file name.  For example:
+
+     make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install
+
+`DESTDIR' should be supported only in the `install*' and `uninstall*'
+targets, as those are the only targets where it is useful.
+
+   If your installation step would normally install
+`/usr/local/bin/foo' and `/usr/local/lib/libfoo.a', then an
+installation invoked as in the example above would install
+`/tmp/stage/usr/local/bin/foo' and `/tmp/stage/usr/local/lib/libfoo.a'
+instead.
+
+   Prepending the variable `DESTDIR' to each target in this way
+provides for "staged installs", where the installed files are not
+placed directly into their expected location but are instead copied
+into a temporary location (`DESTDIR').  However, installed files
+maintain their relative directory structure and any embedded file names
+will not be modified.
+
+   You should not set the value of `DESTDIR' in your `Makefile' at all;
+then the files are installed into their expected locations by default.
+Also, specifying `DESTDIR' should not change the operation of the
+software in any way, so its value should not be included in any file
+contents.
+
+   `DESTDIR' support is commonly used in package creation.  It is also
+helpful to users who want to understand what a given package will
+install where, and to allow users who don't normally have permissions
+to install into protected areas to build and install before gaining
+those permissions.  Finally, it can be useful with tools such as
+`stow', where code is installed in one place but made to appear to be
+installed somewhere else using symbolic links or special mount
+operations.  So, we strongly recommend GNU packages support `DESTDIR',
+though it is not an absolute requirement.
+

+
+14.5 Variables for Installation Directories
+===========================================
+
+Installation directories should always be named by variables, so it is
+easy to install in a nonstandard place.  The standard names for these
+variables and the values they should have in GNU packages are described
+below.  They are based on a standard file system layout; variants of it
+are used in GNU/Linux and other modern operating systems.
+
+   Installers are expected to override these values when calling `make'
+(e.g., `make prefix=/usr install' or `configure' (e.g., `configure
+--prefix=/usr').  GNU packages should not try to guess which value
+should be appropriate for these variables on the system they are being
+installed onto: use the default settings specified here so that all GNU
+packages behave identically, allowing the installer to achieve any
+desired layout.
+
+   All installation directories, and their parent directories, should be
+created (if necessary) before they are installed into.
+
+   These first two variables set the root for the installation.  All the
+other installation directories should be subdirectories of one of these
+two, and nothing should be directly installed into these two
+directories.
+
+`prefix'
+     A prefix used in constructing the default values of the variables
+     listed below.  The default value of `prefix' should be
+     `/usr/local'.  When building the complete GNU system, the prefix
+     will be empty and `/usr' will be a symbolic link to `/'.  (If you
+     are using Autoconf, write it as `@prefix@'.)
+
+     Running `make install' with a different value of `prefix' from the
+     one used to build the program should _not_ recompile the program.
+
+`exec_prefix'
+     A prefix used in constructing the default values of some of the
+     variables listed below.  The default value of `exec_prefix' should
+     be `$(prefix)'.  (If you are using Autoconf, write it as
+     `@exec_prefix@'.)
+
+     Generally, `$(exec_prefix)' is used for directories that contain
+     machine-specific files (such as executables and subroutine
+     libraries), while `$(prefix)' is used directly for other
+     directories.
+
+     Running `make install' with a different value of `exec_prefix'
+     from the one used to build the program should _not_ recompile the
+     program.
+
+   Executable programs are installed in one of the following
+directories.
+
+`bindir'
+     The directory for installing executable programs that users can
+     run.  This should normally be `/usr/local/bin', but write it as
+     `$(exec_prefix)/bin'.  (If you are using Autoconf, write it as
+     `@bindir@'.)
+
+`sbindir'
+     The directory for installing executable programs that can be run
+     from the shell, but are only generally useful to system
+     administrators.  This should normally be `/usr/local/sbin', but
+     write it as `$(exec_prefix)/sbin'.  (If you are using Autoconf,
+     write it as `@sbindir@'.)
+
+`libexecdir'
+     The directory for installing executable programs to be run by other
+     programs rather than by users.  This directory should normally be
+     `/usr/local/libexec', but write it as `$(exec_prefix)/libexec'.
+     (If you are using Autoconf, write it as `@libexecdir@'.)
+
+     The definition of `libexecdir' is the same for all packages, so
+     you should install your data in a subdirectory thereof.  Most
+     packages install their data under `$(libexecdir)/PACKAGE-NAME/',
+     possibly within additional subdirectories thereof, such as
+     `$(libexecdir)/PACKAGE-NAME/MACHINE/VERSION'.
+
+   Data files used by the program during its execution are divided into
+categories in two ways.
+
+   * Some files are normally modified by programs; others are never
+     normally modified (though users may edit some of these).
+
+   * Some files are architecture-independent and can be shared by all
+     machines at a site; some are architecture-dependent and can be
+     shared only by machines of the same kind and operating system;
+     others may never be shared between two machines.
+
+   This makes for six different possibilities.  However, we want to
+discourage the use of architecture-dependent files, aside from object
+files and libraries.  It is much cleaner to make other data files
+architecture-independent, and it is generally not hard.
+
+   Here are the variables Makefiles should use to specify directories
+to put these various kinds of files in:
+
+`datarootdir'
+     The root of the directory tree for read-only
+     architecture-independent data files.  This should normally be
+     `/usr/local/share', but write it as `$(prefix)/share'.  (If you
+     are using Autoconf, write it as `@datarootdir@'.)  `datadir''s
+     default value is based on this variable; so are `infodir',
+     `mandir', and others.
+
+`datadir'
+     The directory for installing idiosyncratic read-only
+     architecture-independent data files for this program.  This is
+     usually the same place as `datarootdir', but we use the two
+     separate variables so that you can move these program-specific
+     files without altering the location for Info files, man pages, etc.
+
+     This should normally be `/usr/local/share', but write it as
+     `$(datarootdir)'.  (If you are using Autoconf, write it as
+     `@datadir@'.)
+
+     The definition of `datadir' is the same for all packages, so you
+     should install your data in a subdirectory thereof.  Most packages
+     install their data under `$(datadir)/PACKAGE-NAME/'.
+
+`sysconfdir'
+     The directory for installing read-only data files that pertain to a
+     single machine-that is to say, files for configuring a host.
+     Mailer and network configuration files, `/etc/passwd', and so
+     forth belong here.  All the files in this directory should be
+     ordinary ASCII text files.  This directory should normally be
+     `/usr/local/etc', but write it as `$(prefix)/etc'.  (If you are
+     using Autoconf, write it as `@sysconfdir@'.)
+
+     Do not install executables here in this directory (they probably
+     belong in `$(libexecdir)' or `$(sbindir)').  Also do not install
+     files that are modified in the normal course of their use (programs
+     whose purpose is to change the configuration of the system
+     excluded).  Those probably belong in `$(localstatedir)'.
+
+`sharedstatedir'
+     The directory for installing architecture-independent data files
+     which the programs modify while they run.  This should normally be
+     `/usr/local/com', but write it as `$(prefix)/com'.  (If you are
+     using Autoconf, write it as `@sharedstatedir@'.)
+
+`localstatedir'
+     The directory for installing data files which the programs modify
+     while they run, and that pertain to one specific machine.  Users
+     should never need to modify files in this directory to configure
+     the package's operation; put such configuration information in
+     separate files that go in `$(datadir)' or `$(sysconfdir)'.
+     `$(localstatedir)' should normally be `/usr/local/var', but write
+     it as `$(prefix)/var'.  (If you are using Autoconf, write it as
+     `@localstatedir@'.)
+
+   These variables specify the directory for installing certain specific
+types of files, if your program has them.  Every GNU package should
+have Info files, so every program needs `infodir', but not all need
+`libdir' or `lispdir'.
+
+`includedir'
+     The directory for installing header files to be included by user
+     programs with the C `#include' preprocessor directive.  This
+     should normally be `/usr/local/include', but write it as
+     `$(prefix)/include'.  (If you are using Autoconf, write it as
+     `@includedir@'.)
+
+     Most compilers other than GCC do not look for header files in
+     directory `/usr/local/include'.  So installing the header files
+     this way is only useful with GCC.  Sometimes this is not a problem
+     because some libraries are only really intended to work with GCC.
+     But some libraries are intended to work with other compilers.
+     They should install their header files in two places, one
+     specified by `includedir' and one specified by `oldincludedir'.
+
+`oldincludedir'
+     The directory for installing `#include' header files for use with
+     compilers other than GCC.  This should normally be `/usr/include'.
+     (If you are using Autoconf, you can write it as `@oldincludedir@'.)
+
+     The Makefile commands should check whether the value of
+     `oldincludedir' is empty.  If it is, they should not try to use
+     it; they should cancel the second installation of the header files.
+
+     A package should not replace an existing header in this directory
+     unless the header came from the same package.  Thus, if your Foo
+     package provides a header file `foo.h', then it should install the
+     header file in the `oldincludedir' directory if either (1) there
+     is no `foo.h' there or (2) the `foo.h' that exists came from the
+     Foo package.
+
+     To tell whether `foo.h' came from the Foo package, put a magic
+     string in the file--part of a comment--and `grep' for that string.
+
+`docdir'
+     The directory for installing documentation files (other than Info)
+     for this package.  By default, it should be
+     `/usr/local/share/doc/YOURPKG', but it should be written as
+     `$(datarootdir)/doc/YOURPKG'.  (If you are using Autoconf, write
+     it as `@docdir@'.)  The YOURPKG subdirectory, which may include a
+     version number, prevents collisions among files with common names,
+     such as `README'.
+
+`infodir'
+     The directory for installing the Info files for this package.  By
+     default, it should be `/usr/local/share/info', but it should be
+     written as `$(datarootdir)/info'.  (If you are using Autoconf,
+     write it as `@infodir@'.)  `infodir' is separate from `docdir' for
+     compatibility with existing practice.
+
+`htmldir'
+`dvidir'
+`pdfdir'
+`psdir'
+     Directories for installing documentation files in the particular
+     format.  They should all be set to `$(docdir)' by default.  (If
+     you are using Autoconf, write them as `@htmldir@', `@dvidir@',
+     etc.)  Packages which supply several translations of their
+     documentation should install them in `$(htmldir)/'LL,
+     `$(pdfdir)/'LL, etc. where LL is a locale abbreviation such as
+     `en' or `pt_BR'.
+
+`libdir'
+     The directory for object files and libraries of object code.  Do
+     not install executables here, they probably ought to go in
+     `$(libexecdir)' instead.  The value of `libdir' should normally be
+     `/usr/local/lib', but write it as `$(exec_prefix)/lib'.  (If you
+     are using Autoconf, write it as `@libdir@'.)
+
+`lispdir'
+     The directory for installing any Emacs Lisp files in this package.
+     By default, it should be `/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp', but it
+     should be written as `$(datarootdir)/emacs/site-lisp'.
+
+     If you are using Autoconf, write the default as `@lispdir@'.  In
+     order to make `@lispdir@' work, you need the following lines in
+     your `configure.ac' file:
+
+          lispdir='${datarootdir}/emacs/site-lisp'
+          AC_SUBST(lispdir)
+
+`localedir'
+     The directory for installing locale-specific message catalogs for
+     this package.  By default, it should be `/usr/local/share/locale',
+     but it should be written as `$(datarootdir)/locale'.  (If you are
+     using Autoconf, write it as `@localedir@'.)  This directory
+     usually has a subdirectory per locale.
+
+   Unix-style man pages are installed in one of the following:
+
+`mandir'
+     The top-level directory for installing the man pages (if any) for
+     this package.  It will normally be `/usr/local/share/man', but you
+     should write it as `$(datarootdir)/man'.  (If you are using
+     Autoconf, write it as `@mandir@'.)
+
+`man1dir'
+     The directory for installing section 1 man pages.  Write it as
+     `$(mandir)/man1'.
+
+`man2dir'
+     The directory for installing section 2 man pages.  Write it as
+     `$(mandir)/man2'
+
+`...'
+     *Don't make the primary documentation for any GNU software be a
+     man page.  Write a manual in Texinfo instead.  Man pages are just
+     for the sake of people running GNU software on Unix, which is a
+     secondary application only.*
+
+`manext'
+     The file name extension for the installed man page.  This should
+     contain a period followed by the appropriate digit; it should
+     normally be `.1'.
+
+`man1ext'
+     The file name extension for installed section 1 man pages.
+
+`man2ext'
+     The file name extension for installed section 2 man pages.
+
+`...'
+     Use these names instead of `manext' if the package needs to
+     install man pages in more than one section of the manual.
+
+   And finally, you should set the following variable:
+
+`srcdir'
+     The directory for the sources being compiled.  The value of this
+     variable is normally inserted by the `configure' shell script.
+     (If you are using Autoconf, use `srcdir = @srcdir@'.)
+
+   For example:
+
+     # Common prefix for installation directories.
+     # NOTE: This directory must exist when you start the install.
+     prefix = /usr/local
+     datarootdir = $(prefix)/share
+     datadir = $(datarootdir)
+     exec_prefix = $(prefix)
+     # Where to put the executable for the command `gcc'.
+     bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin
+     # Where to put the directories used by the compiler.
+     libexecdir = $(exec_prefix)/libexec
+     # Where to put the Info files.
+     infodir = $(datarootdir)/info
+
+   If your program installs a large number of files into one of the
+standard user-specified directories, it might be useful to group them
+into a subdirectory particular to that program.  If you do this, you
+should write the `install' rule to create these subdirectories.
+
+   Do not expect the user to include the subdirectory name in the value
+of any of the variables listed above.  The idea of having a uniform set
+of variable names for installation directories is to enable the user to
+specify the exact same values for several different GNU packages.  In
+order for this to be useful, all the packages must be designed so that
+they will work sensibly when the user does so.
+
+   At times, not all of these variables may be implemented in the
+current release of Autoconf and/or Automake; but as of Autoconf 2.60, we
+believe all of them are.  When any are missing, the descriptions here
+serve as specifications for what Autoconf will implement.  As a
+programmer, you can either use a development version of Autoconf or
+avoid using these variables until a stable release is made which
+supports them.

+
+14.6 Standard Targets for Users
+===============================
+
+All GNU programs should have the following targets in their Makefiles:
+
+`all'
+     Compile the entire program.  This should be the default target.
+     This target need not rebuild any documentation files; Info files
+     should normally be included in the distribution, and DVI (and other
+     documentation format) files should be made only when explicitly
+     asked for.
+
+     By default, the Make rules should compile and link with `-g', so
+     that executable programs have debugging symbols.  Otherwise, you
+     are essentially helpless in the face of a crash, and it is often
+     far from easy to reproduce with a fresh build.
+
+`install'
+     Compile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on
+     to the file names where they should reside for actual use.  If
+     there is a simple test to verify that a program is properly
+     installed, this target should run that test.
+
+     Do not strip executables when installing them.  This helps eventual
+     debugging that may be needed later, and nowadays disk space is
+     cheap and dynamic loaders typically ensure debug sections are not
+     loaded during normal execution.  Users that need stripped binaries
+     may invoke the `install-strip' target to do that.
+
+     If possible, write the `install' target rule so that it does not
+     modify anything in the directory where the program was built,
+     provided `make all' has just been done.  This is convenient for
+     building the program under one user name and installing it under
+     another.
+
+     The commands should create all the directories in which files are
+     to be installed, if they don't already exist.  This includes the
+     directories specified as the values of the variables `prefix' and
+     `exec_prefix', as well as all subdirectories that are needed.  One
+     way to do this is by means of an `installdirs' target as described
+     below.
+
+     Use `-' before any command for installing a man page, so that
+     `make' will ignore any errors.  This is in case there are systems
+     that don't have the Unix man page documentation system installed.
+
+     The way to install Info files is to copy them into `$(infodir)'
+     with `$(INSTALL_DATA)' (*note Command Variables::), and then run
+     the `install-info' program if it is present.  `install-info' is a
+     program that edits the Info `dir' file to add or update the menu
+     entry for the given Info file; it is part of the Texinfo package.
+
+     Here is a sample rule to install an Info file that also tries to
+     handle some additional situations, such as `install-info' not
+     being present.
+
+          do-install-info: foo.info installdirs
+                  $(NORMAL_INSTALL)
+          # Prefer an info file in . to one in srcdir.
+                  if test -f foo.info; then d=.; \
+                   else d="$(srcdir)"; fi; \
+                  $(INSTALL_DATA) $$d/foo.info \
+                    "$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info"
+          # Run install-info only if it exists.
+          # Use `if' instead of just prepending `-' to the
+          # line so we notice real errors from install-info.
+          # Use `$(SHELL) -c' because some shells do not
+          # fail gracefully when there is an unknown command.
+                  $(POST_INSTALL)
+                  if $(SHELL) -c 'install-info --version' \
+                     >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
+                    install-info --dir-file="$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/dir" \
+                                 "$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info"; \
+                  else true; fi
+
+     When writing the `install' target, you must classify all the
+     commands into three categories: normal ones, "pre-installation"
+     commands and "post-installation" commands.  *Note Install Command
+     Categories::.
+
+`install-html'
+`install-dvi'
+`install-pdf'
+`install-ps'
+     These targets install documentation in formats other than Info;
+     they're intended to be called explicitly by the person installing
+     the package, if that format is desired.  GNU prefers Info files,
+     so these must be installed by the `install' target.
+
+     When you have many documentation files to install, we recommend
+     that you avoid collisions and clutter by arranging for these
+     targets to install in subdirectories of the appropriate
+     installation directory, such as `htmldir'.  As one example, if
+     your package has multiple manuals, and you wish to install HTML
+     documentation with many files (such as the "split" mode output by
+     `makeinfo --html'), you'll certainly want to use subdirectories,
+     or two nodes with the same name in different manuals will
+     overwrite each other.
+
+     Please make these `install-FORMAT' targets invoke the commands for
+     the FORMAT target, for example, by making FORMAT a dependency.
+
+`uninstall'
+     Delete all the installed files--the copies that the `install' and
+     `install-*' targets create.
+
+     This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is
+     done, only the directories where files are installed.
+
+     The uninstallation commands are divided into three categories,
+     just like the installation commands.  *Note Install Command
+     Categories::.
+
+`install-strip'
+     Like `install', but strip the executable files while installing
+     them.  In simple cases, this target can use the `install' target in
+     a simple way:
+
+          install-strip:
+                  $(MAKE) INSTALL_PROGRAM='$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) -s' \
+                          install
+
+     But if the package installs scripts as well as real executables,
+     the `install-strip' target can't just refer to the `install'
+     target; it has to strip the executables but not the scripts.
+
+     `install-strip' should not strip the executables in the build
+     directory which are being copied for installation.  It should only
+     strip the copies that are installed.
+
+     Normally we do not recommend stripping an executable unless you
+     are sure the program has no bugs.  However, it can be reasonable
+     to install a stripped executable for actual execution while saving
+     the unstripped executable elsewhere in case there is a bug.
+
+`clean'
+     Delete all files in the current directory that are normally
+     created by building the program.  Also delete files in other
+     directories if they are created by this makefile.  However, don't
+     delete the files that record the configuration.  Also preserve
+     files that could be made by building, but normally aren't because
+     the distribution comes with them.  There is no need to delete
+     parent directories that were created with `mkdir -p', since they
+     could have existed anyway.
+
+     Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
+
+`distclean'
+     Delete all files in the current directory (or created by this
+     makefile) that are created by configuring or building the program.
+     If you have unpacked the source and built the program without
+     creating any other files, `make distclean' should leave only the
+     files that were in the distribution.  However, there is no need to
+     delete parent directories that were created with `mkdir -p', since
+     they could have existed anyway.
+
+`mostlyclean'
+     Like `clean', but may refrain from deleting a few files that people
+     normally don't want to recompile.  For example, the `mostlyclean'
+     target for GCC does not delete `libgcc.a', because recompiling it
+     is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
+
+`maintainer-clean'
+     Delete almost everything that can be reconstructed with this
+     Makefile.  This typically includes everything deleted by
+     `distclean', plus more: C source files produced by Bison, tags
+     tables, Info files, and so on.
+
+     The reason we say "almost everything" is that running the command
+     `make maintainer-clean' should not delete `configure' even if
+     `configure' can be remade using a rule in the Makefile.  More
+     generally, `make maintainer-clean' should not delete anything that
+     needs to exist in order to run `configure' and then begin to build
+     the program.  Also, there is no need to delete parent directories
+     that were created with `mkdir -p', since they could have existed
+     anyway.  These are the only exceptions; `maintainer-clean' should
+     delete everything else that can be rebuilt.
+
+     The `maintainer-clean' target is intended to be used by a
+     maintainer of the package, not by ordinary users.  You may need
+     special tools to reconstruct some of the files that `make
+     maintainer-clean' deletes.  Since these files are normally
+     included in the distribution, we don't take care to make them easy
+     to reconstruct.  If you find you need to unpack the full
+     distribution again, don't blame us.
+
+     To help make users aware of this, the commands for the special
+     `maintainer-clean' target should start with these two:
+
+          @echo 'This command is intended for maintainers to use; it'
+          @echo 'deletes files that may need special tools to rebuild.'
+
+`TAGS'
+     Update a tags table for this program.
+
+`info'
+     Generate any Info files needed.  The best way to write the rules
+     is as follows:
+
+          info: foo.info
+
+          foo.info: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
+                  $(MAKEINFO) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
+
+     You must define the variable `MAKEINFO' in the Makefile.  It should
+     run the `makeinfo' program, which is part of the Texinfo
+     distribution.
+
+     Normally a GNU distribution comes with Info files, and that means
+     the Info files are present in the source directory.  Therefore,
+     the Make rule for an info file should update it in the source
+     directory.  When users build the package, ordinarily Make will not
+     update the Info files because they will already be up to date.
+
+`dvi'
+`html'
+`pdf'
+`ps'
+     Generate documentation files in the given format.  These targets
+     should always exist, but any or all can be a no-op if the given
+     output format cannot be generated.  These targets should not be
+     dependencies of the `all' target; the user must manually invoke
+     them.
+
+     Here's an example rule for generating DVI files from Texinfo:
+
+          dvi: foo.dvi
+
+          foo.dvi: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
+                  $(TEXI2DVI) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
+
+     You must define the variable `TEXI2DVI' in the Makefile.  It
+     should run the program `texi2dvi', which is part of the Texinfo
+     distribution.  (`texi2dvi' uses TeX to do the real work of
+     formatting. TeX is not distributed with Texinfo.)  Alternatively,
+     write only the dependencies, and allow GNU `make' to provide the
+     command.
+
+     Here's another example, this one for generating HTML from Texinfo:
+
+          html: foo.html
+
+          foo.html: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
+                  $(TEXI2HTML) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
+
+     Again, you would define the variable `TEXI2HTML' in the Makefile;
+     for example, it might run `makeinfo --no-split --html' (`makeinfo'
+     is part of the Texinfo distribution).
+
+`dist'
+     Create a distribution tar file for this program.  The tar file
+     should be set up so that the file names in the tar file start with
+     a subdirectory name which is the name of the package it is a
+     distribution for.  This name can include the version number.
+
+     For example, the distribution tar file of GCC version 1.40 unpacks
+     into a subdirectory named `gcc-1.40'.
+
+     The easiest way to do this is to create a subdirectory
+     appropriately named, use `ln' or `cp' to install the proper files
+     in it, and then `tar' that subdirectory.
+
+     Compress the tar file with `gzip'.  For example, the actual
+     distribution file for GCC version 1.40 is called `gcc-1.40.tar.gz'.
+     It is ok to support other free compression formats as well.
+
+     The `dist' target should explicitly depend on all non-source files
+     that are in the distribution, to make sure they are up to date in
+     the distribution.  *Note Making Releases: (standards)Releases.
+
+`check'
+     Perform self-tests (if any).  The user must build the program
+     before running the tests, but need not install the program; you
+     should write the self-tests so that they work when the program is
+     built but not installed.
+
+   The following targets are suggested as conventional names, for
+programs in which they are useful.
+
+`installcheck'
+     Perform installation tests (if any).  The user must build and
+     install the program before running the tests.  You should not
+     assume that `$(bindir)' is in the search path.
+
+`installdirs'
+     It's useful to add a target named `installdirs' to create the
+     directories where files are installed, and their parent
+     directories.  There is a script called `mkinstalldirs' which is
+     convenient for this; you can find it in the Gnulib package.  You
+     can use a rule like this:
+
+          # Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bindir))
+          # actually exist by making them if necessary.
+          installdirs: mkinstalldirs
+                  $(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs $(bindir) $(datadir) \
+                                          $(libdir) $(infodir) \
+                                          $(mandir)
+
+     or, if you wish to support `DESTDIR' (strongly encouraged),
+
+          # Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bindir))
+          # actually exist by making them if necessary.
+          installdirs: mkinstalldirs
+                  $(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs \
+                      $(DESTDIR)$(bindir) $(DESTDIR)$(datadir) \
+                      $(DESTDIR)$(libdir) $(DESTDIR)$(infodir) \
+                      $(DESTDIR)$(mandir)
+
+     This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is
+     done.  It should do nothing but create installation directories.
+
+
+File: make.info,  Node: Install Command Categories,  Prev: Standard Targets,  Up: Makefile Conventions
+
+14.7 Install Command Categories
+===============================
+
+When writing the `install' target, you must classify all the commands
+into three categories: normal ones, "pre-installation" commands and
+"post-installation" commands.
+
+   Normal commands move files into their proper places, and set their
+modes.  They may not alter any files except the ones that come entirely
+from the package they belong to.
+
+   Pre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other
+files; in particular, they can edit global configuration files or data
+bases.
+
+   Pre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal
+commands, and post-installation commands are typically run after the
+normal commands.
+
+   The most common use for a post-installation command is to run
+`install-info'.  This cannot be done with a normal command, since it
+alters a file (the Info directory) which does not come entirely and
+solely from the package being installed.  It is a post-installation
+command because it needs to be done after the normal command which
+installs the package's Info files.
+
+   Most programs don't need any pre-installation commands, but we have
+the feature just in case it is needed.
+
+   To classify the commands in the `install' rule into these three
+categories, insert "category lines" among them.  A category line
+specifies the category for the commands that follow.
+
+   A category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make
+variable, plus an optional comment at the end.  There are three
+variables you can use, one for each category; the variable name
+specifies the category.  Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution
+because these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you
+_should not_ define them in the makefile).
+
+   Here are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that
+explains what it means:
+
+             $(PRE_INSTALL)     # Pre-install commands follow.
+             $(POST_INSTALL)    # Post-install commands follow.
+             $(NORMAL_INSTALL)  # Normal commands follow.
+
+   If you don't use a category line at the beginning of the `install'
+rule, all the commands are classified as normal until the first category
+line.  If you don't use any category lines, all the commands are
+classified as normal.
+
+   These are the category lines for `uninstall':
+
+             $(PRE_UNINSTALL)     # Pre-uninstall commands follow.
+             $(POST_UNINSTALL)    # Post-uninstall commands follow.
+             $(NORMAL_UNINSTALL)  # Normal commands follow.
+
+   Typically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries
+from the Info directory.
+
+   If the `install' or `uninstall' target has any dependencies which
+act as subroutines of installation, then you should start _each_
+dependency's commands with a category line, and start the main target's
+commands with a category line also.  This way, you can ensure that each
+command is placed in the right category regardless of which of the
+dependencies actually run.
+
+   Pre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any
+programs except for these:
+
+     [ basename bash cat chgrp chmod chown cmp cp dd diff echo
+     egrep expand expr false fgrep find getopt grep gunzip gzip
+     hostname install install-info kill ldconfig ln ls md5sum
+     mkdir mkfifo mknod mv printenv pwd rm rmdir sed sort tee
+     test touch true uname xargs yes
+
+   The reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the
+sake of making binary packages.  Typically a binary package contains
+all the executables and other files that need to be installed, and has
+its own method of installing them--so it does not need to run the normal
+installation commands.  But installing the binary package does need to
+execute the pre-installation and post-installation commands.
+
+   Programs to build binary packages work by extracting the
+pre-installation and post-installation commands.  Here is one way of
+extracting the pre-installation commands (the `-s' option to `make' is
+needed to silence messages about entering subdirectories):
+
+     make -s -n install -o all \
+           PRE_INSTALL=pre-install \
+           POST_INSTALL=post-install \
+           NORMAL_INSTALL=normal-install \
+       | gawk -f pre-install.awk
+
+where the file `pre-install.awk' could contain this:
+
+     $0 ~ /^(normal-install|post-install)[ \t]*$/ {on = 0}
+     on {print $0}
+     $0 ~ /^pre-install[ \t]*$/ {on = 1}

+     The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target,
+     with spaces between them.  For prerequisites which are archive
+     members, only the named member is used (*note Archives::).
+
+`$^'
+`$+'
+     The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  For
+     prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is
+     used (*note Archives::).  The value of `$^' omits duplicate
+     prerequisites, while `$+' retains them and preserves their order.
+
+`$*'
+     The stem with which an implicit rule matches (*note How Patterns

+     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of `$+'.
+
+`$(?D)'

+     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of `$?'.
+
+   These variables are used specially by GNU `make':

+     Makefiles to be read on every invocation of `make'.
+     *Note The Variable `MAKEFILES': MAKEFILES Variable.
+
+`VPATH'
+     Directory search path for files not found in the current directory.
+     *Note `VPATH' Search Path for All Prerequisites: General Search.
+
+`SHELL'
+     The name of the system default command interpreter, usually
+     `/bin/sh'.  You can set `SHELL' in the makefile to change the
+     shell used to run recipes.  *Note Recipe Execution: Execution.
+     The `SHELL' variable is handled specially when importing from and

+
+`MAKESHELL'
+     On MS-DOS only, the name of the command interpreter that is to be
+     used by `make'.  This value takes precedence over the value of
+     `SHELL'.  *Note MAKESHELL variable: Execution.
+
+`MAKE'

+     *Note Communicating Options to a Sub-`make': Options/Recursion.
+
+     It is _never_ appropriate to use `MAKEFLAGS' directly in a recipe
+     line: its contents may not be quoted correctly for use in the

+     through the environment from its parent.
+
+`MAKECMDGOALS'
+     The targets given to `make' on the command line.  Setting this

+     *Note Recursive Use of `make': Recursion.
+
+`SUFFIXES'
+     The default list of suffixes before `make' reads any makefiles.

+
+Appendix B Errors Generated by Make
+***********************************
+
+Here is a list of the more common errors you might see generated by
+`make', and some information about what they mean and how to fix them.
+
+   Sometimes `make' errors are not fatal, especially in the presence of
+a `-' prefix on a recipe line, or the `-k' command line option.  Errors
+that are fatal are prefixed with the string `***'.
+
+   Error messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program
+(usually `make'), or, if the error is found in a makefile, the name of
+the file and line number containing the problem.
+
+   In the table below, these common prefixes are left off.
+
+`[FOO] Error NN'
+`[FOO] SIGNAL DESCRIPTION'
+     These errors are not really `make' errors at all.  They mean that a
+     program that `make' invoked as part of a recipe returned a non-0
+     error code (`Error NN'), which `make' interprets as failure, or it
+     exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a signal of some
+     type).  *Note Errors in Recipes: Errors.
+
+     If no `***' is attached to the message, then the sub-process failed
+     but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the `-' special
+     character, so `make' ignored the error.
+
+`missing separator.  Stop.'
+`missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?).  Stop.'
+     This means that `make' could not understand much of anything about
+     the makefile line it just read.  GNU `make' looks for various
+     separators (`:', `=', recipe prefix characters, etc.) to indicate
+     what kind of line it's parsing.  This message means it couldn't
+     find a valid one.
+
+     One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or
+     perhaps your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many
+     MS-Windows editors) have attempted to indent your recipe lines
+     with spaces instead of a tab character.  In this case, `make' will
+     use the second form of the error above.  Remember that every line
+     in the recipe must begin with a tab character (unless you set
+     `.RECIPEPREFIX'; *note Special Variables::).  Eight spaces do not
+     count.  *Note Rule Syntax::.
+
+`recipe commences before first target.  Stop.'
+`missing rule before recipe.  Stop.'
+     This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a
+     recipe: it begins with a recipe prefix character and doesn't
+     appear to be a legal `make' directive (such as a variable
+     assignment).  Recipes must always be associated with a target.
+
+     The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the
+     first non-whitespace character; `make' interprets this to mean you
+     left out the "target: prerequisite" section of a rule.  *Note Rule
+     Syntax::.
+
+`No rule to make target `XXX'.'
+`No rule to make target `XXX', needed by `YYY'.'
+     This means that `make' decided it needed to build a target, but
+     then couldn't find any instructions in the makefile on how to do
+     that, either explicit or implicit (including in the default rules
+     database).
+
+     If you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to
+     your makefile describing how that target can be built.  Other
+     possible sources of this problem are typos in the makefile (if
+     that file name is wrong) or a corrupted source tree (if that file
+     is not supposed to be built, but rather only a prerequisite).
+
+`No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.'
+`No targets.  Stop.'
+     The former means that you didn't provide any targets to be built
+     on the command line, and `make' couldn't find any makefiles to
+     read in.  The latter means that some makefile was found, but it
+     didn't contain any default goal and none was given on the command
+     line.  GNU `make' has nothing to do in these situations.  *Note
+     Arguments to Specify the Makefile: Makefile Arguments.
+
+`Makefile `XXX' was not found.'
+`Included makefile `XXX' was not found.'
+     A makefile specified on the command line (first form) or included
+     (second form) was not found.
+
+`warning: overriding recipe for target `XXX''
+`warning: ignoring old recipe for target `XXX''
+     GNU `make' allows only one recipe to be specified per target
+     (except for double-colon rules).  If you give a recipe for a target
+     which already has been defined to have one, this warning is issued
+     and the second recipe will overwrite the first.  *Note Multiple
+     Rules for One Target: Multiple Rules.
+
+`Circular XXX <- YYY dependency dropped.'
+     This means that `make' detected a loop in the dependency graph:
+     after tracing the prerequisite YYY of target XXX, and its
+     prerequisites, etc., one of them depended on XXX again.
+
+`Recursive variable `XXX' references itself (eventually).  Stop.'
+     This means you've defined a normal (recursive) `make' variable XXX
+     that, when it's expanded, will refer to itself (XXX).  This is not
+     allowed; either use simply-expanded variables (`:=' or `::=') or
+     use the append operator (`+=').  *Note How to Use Variables: Using
+     Variables.
+
+`Unterminated variable reference.  Stop.'
+     This means you forgot to provide the proper closing parenthesis or
+     brace in your variable or function reference.
+
+`insufficient arguments to function `XXX'.  Stop.'
+     This means you haven't provided the requisite number of arguments
+     for this function.  See the documentation of the function for a
+     description of its arguments.  *Note Functions for Transforming
+     Text: Functions.
+
+`missing target pattern.  Stop.'
+`multiple target patterns.  Stop.'
+`target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.'
+`mixed implicit and static pattern rules.  Stop.'
+     These are generated for malformed static pattern rules.  The first
+     means there's no pattern in the target section of the rule; the
+     second means there are multiple patterns in the target section;
+     the third means the target doesn't contain a pattern character
+     (`%'); and the fourth means that all three parts of the static
+     pattern rule contain pattern characters (`%')-only the first two
+     parts should.  *Note Syntax of Static Pattern Rules: Static Usage.
+
+`warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.'
+     This warning and the next are generated if `make' detects error
+     conditions related to parallel processing on systems where
+     sub-`make's can communicate (*note Communicating Options to a
+     Sub-`make': Options/Recursion.).  This warning is generated if a
+     recursive invocation of a `make' process is forced to have `-jN'
+     in its argument list (where N is greater than one).  This could
+     happen, for example, if you set the `MAKE' environment variable to
+     `make -j2'.  In this case, the sub-`make' doesn't communicate with
+     other `make' processes and will simply pretend it has two jobs of
+     its own.
+
+`warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.'
+     In order for `make' processes to communicate, the parent will pass
+     information to the child.  Since this could result in problems if
+     the child process isn't actually a `make', the parent will only do
+     this if it thinks the child is a `make'.  The parent uses the
+     normal algorithms to determine this (*note How the `MAKE' Variable
+     Works: MAKE Variable.).  If the makefile is constructed such that
+     the parent doesn't know the child is a `make' process, then the
+     child will receive only part of the information necessary.  In
+     this case, the child will generate this warning message and
+     proceed with its build in a sequential manner.

+Appendix C Complex Makefile Example
+***********************************
+
+Here is the makefile for the GNU `tar' program.  This is a moderately
+complex makefile.  The first line uses a `#!' setting to allow the
+makefile to be executed directly.
+
+   Because it is the first target, the default goal is `all'.  An
+interesting feature of this makefile is that `testpad.h' is a source
+file automatically created by the `testpad' program, itself compiled
+from `testpad.c'.
+
+   If you type `make' or `make all', then `make' creates the `tar'
+executable, the `rmt' daemon that provides remote tape access, and the
+`tar.info' Info file.
+
+   If you type `make install', then `make' not only creates `tar',
+`rmt', and `tar.info', but also installs them.
+
+   If you type `make clean', then `make' removes the `.o' files, and
+the `tar', `rmt', `testpad', `testpad.h', and `core' files.
+
+   If you type `make distclean', then `make' not only removes the same
+files as does `make clean' but also the `TAGS', `Makefile', and
+`config.status' files.  (Although it is not evident, this makefile (and
+`config.status') is generated by the user with the `configure' program,
+which is provided in the `tar' distribution, but is not shown here.)
+
+   If you type `make realclean', then `make' removes the same files as
+does `make distclean' and also removes the Info files generated from
+`tar.texinfo'.
+
+   In addition, there are targets `shar' and `dist' that create
+distribution kits.

+==================================
+
+                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
+
+     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+     `http://fsf.org/'
+
+     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+  0. PREAMBLE
+
+     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
+     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
+     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
+     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
+     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
+     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
+     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
+
+     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
+     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
+     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
+     license designed for free software.
+
+     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
+     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
+     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
+     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
+     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
+     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
+     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
+     instruction or reference.
+
+  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
+
+     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
+     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
+     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
+     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
+     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
+     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
+     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
+     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
+     way requiring permission under copyright law.
+
+     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
+     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
+     modifications and/or translated into another language.
+
+     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
+     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
+     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
+     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
+     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
+     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
+     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
+     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
+     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
+     regarding them.
+
+     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
+     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
+     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
+     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
+     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
+     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
+     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
+
+     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
+     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
+     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
+     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
+     be at most 25 words.
+
+     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
+     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
+     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
+     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
+     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
+     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
+     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
+     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
+     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
+     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
+     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
+     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
+     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
+
+     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
+     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
+     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
+     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
+     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
+     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
+     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
+     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
+     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
+     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
+
+     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
+     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
+     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
+     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
+     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
+     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
+
+     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
+     of the Document to the public.
+
+     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
+     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
+     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
+     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
+     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
+     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
+     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
+     to this definition.
+
+     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
+     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
+     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
+     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
+     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
+     has no effect on the meaning of this License.
+
+  2. VERBATIM COPYING
+
+     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
+     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
+     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
+     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
+     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
+     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
+     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
+     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
+     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
+     the conditions in section 3.
+
+     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
+     and you may publicly display copies.
+
+  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
+
+     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
+     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
+     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
+     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
+     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
+     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
+     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
+     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
+     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
+     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
+     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
+     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
+     other respects.
+
+     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
+     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
+     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
+     adjacent pages.
+
+     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
+     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
+     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
+     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
+     which the general network-using public has access to download
+     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
+     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
+     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
+     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
+     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
+     location until at least one year after the last time you
+     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
+     retailers) of that edition to the public.
+
+     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
+     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
+     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
+     version of the Document.
+
+  4. MODIFICATIONS
+
+     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
+     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
+     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
+     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
+     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
+     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
+     things in the Modified Version:
+
+       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
+          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
+          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
+          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
+          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
+          that version gives permission.
+
+       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
+          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
+          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
+          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
+          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
+          from this requirement.
+
+       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
+          Modified Version, as the publisher.
+
+       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
+
+       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
+          adjacent to the other copyright notices.
+
+       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
+          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
+          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
+          the Addendum below.
+
+       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
+          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
+          license notice.
+
+       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
+
+       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
+          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
+          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
+          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
+          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
+          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
+          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
+          the previous sentence.
+
+       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
+          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
+          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
+          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
+          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
+          work that was published at least four years before the
+          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
+          it refers to gives permission.
+
+       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
+          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
+          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
+          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
+
+       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
+          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
+          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
+          titles.
+
+       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
+          may not be included in the Modified Version.
+
+       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
+          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
+          Section.
+
+       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
+
+     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
+     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
+     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
+     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
+     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
+     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
+     other section titles.
+
+     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
+     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
+     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
+     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
+     definition of a standard.
+
+     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
+     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
+     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
+     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
+     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
+     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
+     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
+     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
+     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
+     publisher that added the old one.
+
+     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
+     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
+     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
+
+  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
+
+     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
+     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
+     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
+     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
+     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
+     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
+     their Warranty Disclaimers.
+
+     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
+     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
+     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
+     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
+     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
+     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
+     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
+     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
+     combined work.
+
+     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
+     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
+     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
+     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
+     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."
+
+  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
+
+     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
+     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
+     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
+     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
+     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
+     documents in all other respects.
+
+     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
+     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
+     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
+     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
+     that document.
+
+  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
+
+     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
+     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
+     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
+     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
+     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
+     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
+     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
+     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
+
+     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
+     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
+     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
+     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
+     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
+     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
+     the whole aggregate.
+
+  8. TRANSLATION
+
+     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
+     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
+     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
+     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
+     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
+     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
+     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
+     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
+     include the original English version of this License and the
+     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
+     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
+     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
+     prevail.
+
+     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
+     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
+     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
+     actual title.
+
+  9. TERMINATION
+
+     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
+     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
+     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+
+     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
+     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
+     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
+     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
+     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
+     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
+
+     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
+     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
+     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
+     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
+     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
+     after your receipt of the notice.
+
+     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
+     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
+     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
+     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
+     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.
+
+ 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
+
+     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
+     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
+     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
+     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
+     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.
+
+     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
+     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
+     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
+     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
+     that specified version or of any later version that has been
+     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
+     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
+     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
+     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
+     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
+     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
+     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
+
+ 11. RELICENSING
+
+     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
+     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
+     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
+     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
+     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
+     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
+     site.
+
+     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
+     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
+     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
+     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
+     published by that same organization.
+
+     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
+     in part, as part of another Document.
+
+     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
+     License, and if all works that were first published under this
+     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
+     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
+     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
+     to November 1, 2008.
+
+     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
+     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
+     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
+
+
+ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
+====================================================
+
+To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
+the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
+notices just after the title page:
+
+       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
+       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
+       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
+       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
+       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
+       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
+       Free Documentation License''.
+
+   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
+Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
+
+         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
+         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
+         being LIST.
+
+   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
+combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
+situation.
+
+   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
+recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
+free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
+permit their use in free software.
